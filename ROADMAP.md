## Milestone 1 — APS-001 and Full Review (Target: v0.2.0)

Priority: **Critical** — APS-001 is the root normative draft and remains the principal blocker until reviewed and approved.

- [ ] Stabilize APS-001 Protocol Specification draft
- [ ] Architecture Review of APS-001
- [ ] Align APS-100 through APS-950 authority citations to APS-001
- [ ] Advance APS-000 to Approved status

---

## Milestone 2 — Canonical Data Model and Evidence Pack (Target: v0.3.0)

Priority: **High** — blocking conformance testing.

- [ ] Define APS-200 entity schemas with precise field types and constraints
- [ ] Define APS-300 canonical Evidence Pack schema with exact field names and cryptographic algorithm
- [ ] Publish JSON Schema for all APS-200 entities
- [ ] Publish JSON Schema for APS-300 Evidence Pack
- [ ] Advance APS-200 and APS-300 to Approved status

---

## Milestone 3 — Conformance Test Suite (Target: v0.4.0)

Priority: **High** — enables formal certification.

- [ ] Define CONF-001 through CONF-010 with full test procedures and pass/fail criteria
- [ ] Define FIX-001 through FIX-010 canonical reference fixtures
- [ ] Publish machine-readable fixture format
- [ ] Advance APS-400 and APS-500 to Approved status

---

## Milestone 4 — Compliance Mapping and First Certification (Target: v1.0.0)

Priority: **Medium**.

- [ ] Automate traceability matrix generation
- [ ] Define Compliance Report format
- [ ] Conduct first Architecture Review of reference implementations against full APS
- [ ] Publish first Conformance Reports for RI-PY and RI-RS
- [ ] Advance all APS documents to Approved or Frozen status
- [ ] Release v1.0.0 of aura-specification

---

## Future Considerations

- Binary evidence envelope format
- Cross-language Evidence verifiers
- Formal verification of Protocol Invariants
- APS-600 (TODO — reserved for future use)
- APS-700 (TODO — reserved for future use)
- Kubernetes-style Enhancement Proposal (AEP) process
- Public certification program
