# CK-003 Specification Closure Workspace

Controlled workspace for closing the Aura Protocol specification.

## Authority

Normative authority remains with the approved Constitution, APS documents, approved ADRs, and the specification itself. Artifacts in this directory are classified explicitly and do not become normative merely by being present here.

## Closure gates

- **GATE A — Specification Closure:** APS-001, DQ-002, DQ-003, DQ-004, semantic decision space, canonical serialization, hash-domain, version semantics, event-type semantics.
- **GATE B — Conformance:** INV-001…INV-015 mapping, canonical fixtures, RI-PY, RI-RS, and cross-language equality.
- **GATE C — Automation:** conformance runner, specification/core/guard CI gates, and evidence artifacts.
- **GATE D — Release:** traceability, security/threat review, regulatory mapping, architecture review, and freeze for Aura specification v1.0.

## Status vocabulary

`NORMATIVE` · `DECISION` · `EVIDENCE` · `TEST` · `WORKING` · `SUPERSEDED` · `OPEN` · `CLOSED` · `BLOCKED`

## Existing CK-003 evidence

DQ-002 already has a dedicated evidence package under `ck003/dq-002-hash-domain/`. DQ-003 work is maintained on its dedicated branch until consolidated into the closure branch.

The current consolidated DQ status register is [`ck003/CK003_BLOCKER_REGISTER.md`](CK003_BLOCKER_REGISTER.md).

## DQ-006 closure

The single authoritative DQ-006 record is [`closures/DQ-006_CLOSURE_PACKAGE.md`](../closures/DQ-006_CLOSURE_PACKAGE.md). Everything under `ck003/dq-006-closure/` and `ck003/dq-006-canonical-serialization/` is superseded working history and MUST NOT be cited as current status.

The normative canonical serialization rule lives in **APS-200 §8** (single authority), with the evidence-hash byte domain in **APS-300 §5**, the decision in **ADR-CK003-DQ006**, and the conformance requirement in **CONF-003**.

**DQ-006 status: OPEN** — specification decision settled; final conformance closure evidence remains incomplete.

CROSS-LANGUAGE-001 establishes PASS for CANONICAL-001 byte, SHA-256 and RFC 6962 leaf equality. It does not by itself prove RFC 8785 profile discrimination. Closure is therefore withheld until the mandatory final-closure execution order is satisfied.

### Final closure execution

The controlled execution order is [`ck003/dq-006-final-closure-execution/DQ-006_FINAL_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_ORDER.md`](dq-006-final-closure-execution/DQ-006_FINAL_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_ORDER.md).

The mandatory residuals are:

- **R1:** execute a JCS-discriminating fixture independently in RI-PY and RI-RS;
- **R2:** select and document exactly one authoritative RI-RS conformance boundary;
- **R3:** make the cited reference-implementation evidence reachable from reviewable/default branches or an explicitly accepted immutable publication mechanism;
- **R4:** Chief Architect ratification after R1–R3 and evidence review.

No status transition to `CLOSED` may be inferred from CANONICAL-001 equality alone.

This does not by itself close DQ-002, APS-001, INV-001…INV-015, or the release gate.

## Operating rule

No production implementation change is implied by a CK-003 evidence artifact. Normative decisions are promoted only after review, fixture verification, and explicit closure status.
