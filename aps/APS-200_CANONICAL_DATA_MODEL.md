# APS-200 — Canonical Data Model

Document ID: APS-200  
Version: 1.0-DRAFT  
Status: DRAFT  
Classification: Normative Specification  
Authority: APS-001 §3, §4, §7, §12 · APS-100  
Last Review: 2026-09-26

## 1. Purpose

APS-200 defines the canonical data model of the Aura Protocol.

Every conformant implementation MUST represent information in accordance with this document. Internal structures MAY differ, but data semantics and contract MUST be equivalent.

---

## 2. Design Principles

The data model MUST be:
- **Deterministic** — same data → same representation
- **Unambiguous** — no field has multiple valid interpretations
- **Extensible** — new fields MAY be added without breaking existing contracts
- **Versionable** — every object carries version information
- **Language-independent** — the model is not tied to any programming language
- **Serialization-independent** — the model is not tied to any wire format

---

## 3. Core Entities

| ID | Entity | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| ENT-001 | Protocol Header | Execution metadata |
| ENT-002 | Evaluation Request | Input data |
| ENT-003 | Evaluation Result | Output of evaluation |
| ENT-004 | Policy Reference | Reference to the policy used |
| ENT-005 | Evidence | Execution proof |
| ENT-006 | Attestation | Formal conformance confirmation |
| ENT-007 | Audit Record | Immutable auditable event record |
| ENT-008 | Implementation Metadata | Information about the implementation |

---

## 4. Common Object Contract

Every entity MUST contain the following fields:

| Field | Type | Requirement | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `object_id` | string | MUST | Globally unique identifier (UUID v4 or canonical format) |
| `object_type` | string | MUST | APS-000 canonical type name (e.g., `EvaluationRequest`) |
| `protocol_version` | string | MUST | APS version this object conforms to (e.g., `1.0`) |
| `schema_version` | string | MUST | Schema version of this entity definition |
| `created_at` | string (ISO 8601) | MUST | Timestamp of object creation (UTC) |
| `integrity_hash` | string | MUST | `SHA-256(canonical_bytes)` of this object, excluding `integrity_hash` itself. Canonical bytes are defined by §8. |

> **Note on self-reference.** A digest field cannot cover its own value. `integrity_hash` therefore excludes itself from the canonicalized object, matching the rule already stated for `evidence_hash` in APS-300 §5. This makes an existing implicit constraint explicit; it does not introduce a new one.

---

## 5. Entity Definitions

### ENT-001 — Protocol Header

## 6. Relationships

```
Evaluation Request (ENT-002)
        │
        ▼
Evaluation Result (ENT-003)
        │
        ▼
Evidence (ENT-005)
        │
        ▼
Attestation (ENT-006)
        │
        ▼
Audit Record (ENT-007)
```

Every relationship MUST be traceable via object_id references.

---

## 7. Validation Rules

Every object MUST pass:
1. Structure validation (required fields present)
2. Type validation (field types match schema)
3. Required field validation
4. Integrity validation (integrity_hash matches computed hash)
5. APS-100 invariant validation

---

## 8. Serialization Requirements

For the current normative JSON interoperability profile, implementations MUST use **RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)** when canonical JSON serialization is required by this specification.

The canonical serialization boundary is the UTF-8 byte sequence emitted by the JCS profile. Semantic JSON equivalence, map insertion order, implementation-specific serializers, whitespace conventions, or textual/hexadecimal representations MUST NOT be used as substitutes for canonical-byte equality.

For a canonical object `O`:

```text
JCS(O) = canonical UTF-8 bytes B
SHA-256(B) = record/integrity digest where applicable
SHA-256(0x00 || B) = RFC 6962-style leaf hash where applicable
```

The leaf prefix `0x00` is one raw octet. It MUST NOT be represented as the ASCII characters `0x00`, a hexadecimal string, or another textual wrapper. RFC 6962-style interior-node hashing uses `0x01` followed by the two raw 32-byte child digests.

The canonicalization/hash boundary is implementation-independent. RI-PY and RI-RS have independently executed CANONICAL-001 under CK-003 DQ-006 and produced byte-identical canonical bytes, SHA-256 digests and leaf digests. The corresponding closure evidence is normative decision evidence, not a production dependency requirement.

Conformance engines used for this verification are:

- RI-PY: `rfc8785==0.1.4` — conformance-only;
- RI-RS: `serde_json_canonicalizer==0.3.2` — conformance-only.

These implementation dependencies do not mandate insertion of either library into production runtime code. Production implementations MUST satisfy the RFC 8785 semantics; the named engines are reference conformance tools.

The canonical serialization profile is version-bound. A change affecting canonical bytes, number/string serialization, field inclusion, hash-domain inputs, or conformance outcomes MUST be treated as a versioned protocol change and MUST undergo compatibility and fixture impact analysis.

### CANONICAL-001 reference vector

Input object:

```json
{"event_type":"AUDIT_RECORD","payload":{"value":42},"protocol_version":"1.0","schema_version":"1.0"}
```

Canonical byte length: `100`.

Canonical bytes (hex):

```text
7b226576656e745f74797065223a2241554449545f5245434f5244222c227061796c6f6164223a7b2276616c7565223a34327d2c2270726f746f636f6c5f76657273696f6e223a22312e30222c22736368656d615f76657273696f6e223a22312e30227d
```

SHA-256:

```text
b6c3660ce6dee498b37443a92bf87c5efead6fe863fcf19197c0baeda139a4e6
```

RFC 6962 leaf:

```text
ce6b36733d97699230f37d80a14e14104c19d2e787526a6fc3aaae6b6648c039
```

The executable cross-language evidence and provenance are maintained under `ck003/dq-006-closure/` and the reference implementation conformance repositories.

---

## 9. JSON Schema

Machine-readable schema definitions for canonical fixtures and shared object contracts are maintained under `fixtures/schemas/`. Entity-specific schemas remain subject to APS-200 completion and MUST be added before APS-001 v1.0 approval where required by the relevant entity contract.

The event-type vocabulary and validation contract are governed by `aps/EVENT_TYPE_REGISTRY.md`. That registry MUST be incorporated into the approved APS-200 profile before DQ-004 can be closed.
