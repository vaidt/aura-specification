Document ID: APS-400  
Version: 1.0-DRAFT  
Status: DRAFT  
Classification: Normative Specification  
Authority: APS-001 §9, §11 · APS-100 · APS-200 · APS-300

## 1. Purpose

APS-400 defines the official set of Conformance Tests that every Aura implementation MUST pass to be considered conformant with the protocol.

Assignment of a `CONF-xxx` identifier is a structural requirement only. It does **not** constitute execution evidence or a PASS result.

## 2. Test Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Functional | Correctness of protocol function |
| Determinism | Repeatability of results |
| Replay | Reproducibility of executions |
| Serialization | Conformance with Canonical Data Model |
| Evidence | Correctness of Evidence Pack |
| Integrity | Data integrity verification |
| Security | Security requirement verification |
| Compatibility | Protocol version compatibility |

## 3. Test Definition

Every test MUST define Test ID, Name, Purpose, Related APS sections, Related Invariant(s), Preconditions, Test Procedure, Expected Result, Evidence Required, and PASS / FAIL Criteria.

Full test definitions: [../conformance/](../conformance/)

### 4.1 Current execution readiness posture

The current repository state distinguishes structural assignment from executable readiness:

| Test ID | Execution posture | Current limiting factor |
|---|---|---|
| CONF-001 | READY | controlled draft verifier exists for `FIX-001`; implementation-side execution evidence is still missing |
| CONF-002 | BLOCKED | replay fixture corpus not yet authored |
| CONF-003 | OPEN | cross-language evidence exists, but the corpus still lacks a JCS-discriminating vector |
| CONF-004 | READY | controlled draft verifier exists for `FIX-001`; implementation-side execution evidence is still missing |
| CONF-005 | READY | controlled draft verifier exists for `FIX-001`; implementation-side execution evidence is still missing |
| CONF-006 | READY | controlled draft verifier exists for `FIX-001`; implementation-side cross-platform evidence is still missing |
| CONF-007 | BLOCKED | error-handling fixture missing |
| CONF-008 | BLOCKED | DQ-003 compatibility matrix and bound fixture missing |
| CONF-009 | OPEN | structural mapping exists, but the full invariant-to-execution gate is not yet evidenced |
| CONF-010 | READY | controlled draft verifier exists for `FIX-001`; implementation-side execution evidence is still missing |
| CONF-011 | READY | working fixture exists; remaining step is controlled execution evidence |
| CONF-012 | BLOCKED | DQ-004 event-type registry closure required |
| CONF-013 | READY | working fixture exists, but one concrete policy/input binding is still needed before execution |
| CONF-014 | BLOCKED | APS-500 corpus version is not yet normatively frozen |
| CONF-015 | BLOCKED | APS-000 / APS-200 identity contract still incomplete |

### CONF-001…CONF-010

The existing definitions remain authoritative for CONF-001 through CONF-010. See the corresponding files in [../conformance/](../conformance/).

### CONF-011 — Zero Float Runtime
**Related Invariant:** INV-007  
**Purpose:** Verify that the protocol execution path contains no prohibited floating-point operations where they would violate deterministic execution.  
**PASS Criterion:** static analysis identifies no prohibited runtime float operations and applicable deterministic fixtures pass.  
See [../conformance/CONF-011_ZERO_FLOAT_RUNTIME.md](../conformance/CONF-011_ZERO_FLOAT_RUNTIME.md)

### CONF-012 — Auditability
**Related Invariant:** INV-012  
**Purpose:** Verify that every protocol-governed execution leaves a conformant ENT-007 Audit Record.  
**PASS Criterion:** required Audit Record exists, validates against applicable schema and event-type semantics, and integrity/chain verification succeeds.  
See [../conformance/CONF-012_AUDITABILITY.md](../conformance/CONF-012_AUDITABILITY.md)

### CONF-013 — Policy Determinism
**Related Invariant:** INV-013  
**Purpose:** Verify identical decisions for identical inputs under the same pinned policy version.  
**PASS Criterion:** all decision and digest-domain outputs are identical.  
See [../conformance/CONF-013_POLICY_DETERMINISM.md](../conformance/CONF-013_POLICY_DETERMINISM.md)

### CONF-014 — Reference Compatibility
**Related Invariant:** INV-014  
**Purpose:** Verify that every applicable normative APS-500 Reference Fixture passes.  
**PASS Criterion:** all applicable fixtures return their normative expected results.  
See [../conformance/CONF-014_REFERENCE_COMPATIBILITY.md](../conformance/CONF-014_REFERENCE_COMPATIBILITY.md)

### CONF-015 — Canonical Identity
**Related Invariant:** INV-015  
**Purpose:** Verify valid, unique and traceable canonical identity for every applicable protocol artifact.  
**PASS Criterion:** all applicable artifacts satisfy identity syntax, semantics and uniqueness requirements.  
See [../conformance/CONF-015_CANONICAL_IDENTITY.md](../conformance/CONF-015_CANONICAL_IDENTITY.md)

## 5. Test Results

Each test execution returns one of: **PASS**, **FAIL**, **PARTIAL**, **NOT APPLICABLE**, **ERROR**.

Repository planning and traceability work may also classify a test as **OPEN**, **BLOCKED**, **READY**, or **NOT VERIFIED** before or between executions. These are readiness states, not PASS-equivalent outcomes.

Assignment of a CONF identifier does not constitute a PASS result.

## 6. Conformance Report

After executing all tests, an implementation generates a report containing implementation identifier, protocol version, tests executed, results, Evidence Pack identifier and execution date.

Template: [../templates/CONFORMANCE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md](../templates/CONFORMANCE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md)

## 7. Certification Rules

An implementation MAY be marked Aura Protocol Conformant only if all mandatory tests return PASS, no mandatory test remains OPEN / BLOCKED / READY / NOT VERIFIED, a valid Evidence Pack has been generated, and the applicable APS version is current.

## 8. Traceability Matrix
