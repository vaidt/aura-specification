## Authority notice

This is an **observational audit record**. It is not a specification, not a
governance decision, not an authority artifact, and not a decision package. It
creates no normative semantics, promotes nothing to authority, and settles
nothing.

Where this record uses the words *observed*, *recorded*, *declared* or
*reachable*, they are statements about the corpus as read on the date above.
Where a source's own token is quoted, it is quoted verbatim and is **not**
replaced. Every normalized reading given alongside a source token is a reading
aid attached to this audit only; it does not amend the source.

**No artifact under audit was edited, renamed, moved, merged or repaired.**

## 1. SCOPE AND METHOD

### 1.1 Repositories in scope

| Repository | `main`/`master` at audit time | Working tree at audit time |
|---|---|---|
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-specification` | `528de0de6d34a4a7ff541db9cd93238587dac9ef` | clean |
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` | `43f054f8deb7c9644c52148d6496b493512d32b0` | clean |
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-guard-v1.3` | `35082d7b4880dad780fb55a1a5f3ac0ef4322674` | clean |
| `Aura-IDToken/.github` | `95f017a833950d77542ebcf579a8c172f9027173` | clean |
| `Aura-IDToken/cargo` | `92e3ebe…` (vendored upstream mirror) | clean |

### 1.2 Reference sets actually searched

Reachability and absence claims in this record are bounded by the ref sets
below. Where a ref set is partial, the bound is stated at the point of use.

| Repository | Remote heads | Refs fetched and searched | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aura-specification` | 56 | **all 56 heads + 1 tag** | complete |
| `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` | 79 | **all 79 heads** | complete |
| `aura-guard-v1.3` | not enumerated | `main` (checkout) | **partial — branch coverage NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| `.github` | not enumerated | default branch (checkout) | **partial** |
| `cargo` | not enumerated | default branch (checkout) | **partial — no Aura governance content observed** |

Token searches over `aura-specification` and `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` were run
across `git rev-list --all` rather than over a checkout, so an absent token is
absent from every commit reachable from every fetched ref of those two
repositories. For `aura-guard-v1.3`, `.github` and `cargo`, absence is asserted
only for the checked-out branch.

### 1.3 Method

Read-only. Files were read; git objects were resolved; two digests were
recomputed (§1.4). No program under audit was executed, no receiver was
invoked, no test suite was run, no conformance procedure was entered.

### 1.4 Recomputation performed (read-only, non-authoritative)

Two integrity facts were recomputed rather than copied, so that this record does
not merely restate a claim it cannot check:

| Object | Recomputed value | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `conformance/boundary/p01/FIX-DIGEST-P01.canonical.json` (bytes) | 15 octets; content `{"a":1,"b":"x"}`; SHA-256 `ecf9e98ec0641e23113ff3ce8bdc78d0ddd249886517fd4a7f68cc83d4e65667` | `wc -c`, `sha256sum` on the worktree file |
| same file (git identity) | blob `b45ffa980a1a776b6143d7fcb255fbfa8a436582` | `git ls-tree origin/main` |

Both agree with the values recorded in `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-CLOSURE-RECORD.md` §6
and in the two Decision Packages. **This is a byte-identity check only.** It is
not an issuance check, not a conformance check, and establishes nothing about
authority. See AD-N-011.

### 1.5 Identifier namespaces used by this record

The corpus already occupies several short identifier namespaces (`N-01…N-17`,
`D-1…D-10`, `DIV-01…DIV-07`, `CFL-001…005`, `C-1/C-2`, `A-1…A-8`, `B-1…B-5`,
`S-1…S-18`, `PRE-01-*`). To avoid adding to the collisions this audit is
recording, every identifier minted here carries an `AD-` prefix:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AD-I-nnn` | inventory record |
| `AD-DIV-nnn` | declaration-vs-content divergence |
| `AD-CFL-nnn` | conflict register entry |
| `AD-N-nnn` | normalization finding |
| `AD-OS-nnn` | open load-bearing surface |

The mandate for this audit specifies findings numbered `N-001…`. Those findings
appear here as `AD-N-001…`; the `AD-` prefix is a collision-avoidance measure
recorded as AD-N-021, not a renumbering of anything in the corpus.

---

## 2. DOCUMENT INVENTORY

52 load-bearing artifacts are inventoried. Each appears once in an **identity**
table (repository, path, commit, blob, reachability, class) and once in a
**status** table (declared status, content-observed status, authority claim,
authority evidence, semantic status, evidence status, execution status,
supersession evidence, dependencies, conflicts, notes).

Reachability vocabulary: `REACHABLE_FROM_MAIN` · `BRANCH_LOCAL` · `UNREACHABLE`
· `UNKNOWN`. Blob identifiers are truncated to 12 hex characters where the full
value is not load-bearing.

Each of the following is cited by a load-bearing record as an input or an
authority, and was **not found** on any of the 56 `aura-specification` refs or
79 `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` refs searched.

**Absence bound.** Every "UNREACHABLE" above is bounded by §1.2. It means *not
present on the refs searched*. It is **not** a finding that the artifact does
not exist, was never created, or cannot be supplied.

|---|---|
| AD-I-027 | Declares *"Authority created by this record: NONE"* while performing a governance act (declaring one record superseded by another as *"current custodian state"*) and issuing a *"Custodian decision"* (§14). It is either an AUTHORITY_RECORD that disclaims authority, or an AUDIT that performs one. **Not resolved here.** |
| AD-I-032 | Consumed throughout the corpus as an issued FIXTURE, but no issuance or Registry artifact exists. It is a verified data artifact whose fixture status is exactly what Decision A turns on. Recorded as `FIXTURE (contested)`. |
| AD-I-045, AD-I-048 | Each is simultaneously an AUDIT (normalization pass over prior records), a DECISION_RECORD (packages two named decisions), and a routing instrument. Both disclaim authority. |
| AD-I-051 | Declares itself `MANDATORY / NON-OVERRIDABLE` with `AUTHORITY: Custodian of the Protocol` — a constitutional claim from the implementation corpus over a protocol-level subject. Whether it is GOVERNANCE at protocol tier or at instrument tier **is C-2**, and is not answered here. |
| AD-I-062 | An implementation-corpus DECISION_RECORD stating a protocol-level adoption (*"Aura adopts RI-RS as the canonical hash-domain model"*). Class depends on C-2. |

## 4. STATUS NORMALIZATION

### 4.1 Source tokens observed, verbatim

The corpus uses at least the following status tokens. **Each is preserved as
written in §2. None is replaced.**

`FROZEN` · `FROZEN (po zatwierdzeniu)` · `DRAFT` · `1.0-DRAFT` · `0.2-DRAFT` ·
`TODO` · `PROPOSED` · `ACCEPTED` · `CONSTRUCTED` · `NOT STARTED` · `COMPLETE` ·
`CLOSED` · `CLOSED AT THE EVIDENCE-GENERATION LAYER` · `CONDITIONALLY CLOSED /
CI-BLOCKED` · `BLOCKED` · `BLOCKED — CONSTRUCTION GAP` · `PASS` · `FAIL` ·
`SATISFIED` · `MET` · `UNMET` · `OPEN` · `UNKNOWN` · `NOT ESTABLISHED` ·
`NOT DETERMINED` · `NOT EXECUTED` · `NO RESULT` · `NOT CERTIFIED` ·
`PENDING_EXECUTION` · `OUTCOME B` · `INCOHERENT` · `STOPPED` ·
`MANDATORY / NON-OVERRIDABLE` · `CANONICAL` · `VALIDATED` · `TRANSFERRED`

**35 distinct status tokens** across the audited set.

### 4.2 The four dimensions, kept separate

This audit records four independent dimensions per artifact (§2). They are not
collapsed, and a value in one does not imply a value in another. The two
distinctions that carry the most weight in this corpus:

```text
DECLARED STATUS        is what a document says about itself.
CONTENT-OBSERVED       is what reading the document and its referents shows.

A declared status is never converted into a semantic status here.
```

```text
EXECUTION STATUS  ≠  SEMANTIC STATUS
NOT EXECUTED      is not FAIL.
BLOCKED           is not FAIL.
PASS (engineering validation)  is not  PASS (conformance).
```

### 4.3 Worked normalizations where declaration and support diverge

Given only where the source itself supplies the distinction:

| Artifact | DECLARED STATUS (verbatim) | NORMALIZED SEMANTIC STATUS | Why the source supports the distinction |
|---|---|---|---|
| AD-I-031 | `R-VAL-001…012 — 24/24 PASS` | **NOT DETERMINED** (as to conformance) | AD-I-027 §8 states in the source itself: *"These are receipt/schema validation assertions. They are **not** conformance assertions and MUST NOT be converted into a protocol result."* |
| AD-I-039 | `PRE-01 — PASS` | **NOT DETERMINED** (as to binding) | The same record's §I.1 limits it to *"the schema layer only"*; no receiver implements v2 |
| AD-I-027 | `CLOSED AT THE EVIDENCE-GENERATION LAYER` | **ESTABLISHED** for evidence generation; **NOT DETERMINED** for conformance | The record's own §13 semantic boundary: *"REAL EVIDENCE ≠ CONFORMANCE RESULT"* |
| AD-I-028 | `BC-02  CLOSED` (state table) | **NOT DETERMINED** | The BC-02 contract itself (AD-I-035 §19) self-states `BLOCKED — BC-02 CONSTRUCTION GAP`; the source does not reconcile the two |
| AD-I-026 | `COMPLETE` | **ESTABLISHED** for the handoff event; **NOT DETERMINED** for anything downstream | The record confines itself to the handoff and disclaims conformance |
| AD-I-021 | `Status: DRAFT` + body *"normative conformance requirement"* | **NOT DETERMINED** | The source carries both statements and reconciles neither |
| AD-I-002 | `FROZEN (po zatwierdzeniu)` | **NOT DETERMINED** | The parenthetical makes the freeze conditional; the English copy (AD-I-001) makes it unconditional; no source reconciles them |

For every other artifact in §2 where declaration and support do not diverge, the
declared token stands and the normalized reading is recorded in the same row.

## 5. DECLARATION VS CORPUS CONTENT — DIVERGENCE REGISTER

Every entry below carries `RESOLUTION: NONE`. **No source is chosen as correct.**

---

**AD-DIV-001 — APS-001 status**
- SOURCE A: `releases/v0.1.0/DOCUMENT_STATUS.md` (AD-I-006), row *Protocol Specification*
- SOURCE B: `specification/APS-001_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` (AD-I-010), header
- EXACT LOCATION: A — status table row `APS-001`; B — lines 2–4
- DECLARED STATE: A — `Version 0.1-DRAFT`, `Status: TODO`
- OBSERVED STATE: B — `Version: 0.2-DRAFT`, `Status: DRAFT — ARCHITECTURE REVIEW REQUIRED`
- TYPE: status-snapshot vs current document; no supersession marker on A
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-002 — CONF-003 normativity**
- SOURCE A: `conformance/CONF-003_CANONICAL_SERIALIZATION.md` header
- SOURCE B: same file, body, first paragraph
- DECLARED STATE: A — `Status: DRAFT`; B — *"This document is a normative conformance requirement."*
- OBSERVED STATE: a DRAFT document asserting in-force normative effect over implementations
- TYPE: header-vs-body; same artifact
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-003 — BC-02.2 / BC-02.3 gate state on `main`**
- SOURCE A: `BC-02.1-COMMON-RECEIPT-SCHEMA-v1.md` §18 (AD-I-023)
- SOURCE B: `BC-02.3-RI-RS-RECEIVER-v1.md` §7 (AD-I-024)
- DECLARED STATE: A — `BC-02.2 RI-PY  NOT STARTED`, `BC-02.3 RI-RS  NOT STARTED`; B — both `CONSTRUCTED`
- OBSERVED STATE: **both records are on `main` simultaneously and are not reconciled there.** AD-I-025 §7 and AD-I-027 §11 (`D-OBS-01`) each record A as stale and each state it was deliberately not modified
- TYPE: contradictory gate snapshots inside one reachable corpus
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-004 — BLOCKED headers standing after the blocked event occurred**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-029 (`RI-PY EXECUTION BLOCKED`, 2026-08-23 20:18) and AD-I-025 (`BLOCKED — RI-PY source_commit provenance…`, 21:19)
- SOURCE B: AD-I-026 (`COMPLETE`, 21:40) with both receipts
- DECLARED STATE: A — BLOCKED, unqualified, on the document face
- OBSERVED STATE: the blocking conditions were subsequently closed; **neither A carries a supersession marker**
- TYPE: superseded-in-fact disposition presented as current
- **RESOLUTION: NONE** — AD-I-027 §5 asserts supersession over AD-I-025; see AD-CFL-008
- Already recorded in the corpus as `D-6` (AD-I-045) — reproduced here because it remains open

**AD-DIV-005 — "Authority created: NONE" alongside a governance act**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-027 §2: *"Authority created by this record: **NONE**. It is non-normative."*
- SOURCE B: same record, §5 (*"The present record supersedes it as the current custodian state"*), §13 (gate state), §14 (*"Custodian decision"*)
- TYPE: self-declared non-authority vs performed governance effect
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-006 — cross-branch citation from `main`**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-027 §15, on `main`, citing *"`BC-02_BOUNDARY_VALIDATION_RECORD.md` §5.1"*
- SOURCE B: that file exists only at `b90112b` on `claude/bc-02-boundary-validation-q0h7yg`
- OBSERVED STATE: a `main`-only reader cannot resolve the citation
- TYPE: broken reference from a reachable record to a branch-local one
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-007 — PRE-01 disposition**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-037 §1: *"PRE-01: OPEN — BINDING GAP (Outcome B)"*
- SOURCE B: AD-I-039 §I: *"PRE-01 — PASS"*
- OBSERVED STATE: on their faces the two contradict; B's own §I.1 scopes the PASS to *"the schema layer only"*; A is branch-local and B is branch-local on a **different** branch
- TYPE: contradictory status tokens for one identifier across two unreachable-from-`main` records
- **RESOLUTION: NONE** — corpus records this as `D-1` (AD-I-045) and `DIV-05` (AD-I-048), neither resolving it

**AD-DIV-008 — one harness, two verdicts**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-039 / AD-I-042 — `PRE-01-001…010` reported passing
- SOURCE B: AD-I-041 §R and AD-I-045 §7 — the same harness reports `PRE-01-010` **FAIL**
- OBSERVED STATE: the failure is attributed by both sources to a later work package adding a file outside PRE-01's authorized path set, not to a regression
- TYPE: execution result whose meaning changes with the file set, presented as a validation verdict
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-009 — "occurs in no reachable commit"**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-045 §2 (commit `66bfdb1`, 2026-08-24T20:12:29Z): *"The terms Decision A, Decision B, Decision Package and Terrain Survey occur in **no reachable commit of any in-scope repository**"*
- SOURCE B: AD-I-047 (commit `9bbe7ff`, 2026-08-24T17:03:11Z, branch `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q`) contains the term *Terrain survey* in its own status table
- OBSERVED STATE: B precedes A by 3h09m. The two commits are on **disjoint branches**; B is not reachable from A's branch, and A's sentence does not state which ref set it measured
- TYPE: corpus-wide absence claim measured against an unstated ref set
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-010 — "exactly one decision package exists"**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-046 §1.1 (commit `a10ca5c`, 2026-08-24T22:20:34Z): *"**No file of that name exists in any reachable commit of any in-scope repository.** Exactly one decision package exists"*, naming `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` as ABSENT
- SOURCE B: AD-I-048 — a file at exactly that path, commit `dd11311`, 2026-08-24T20:26:23Z, 1h54m earlier
- OBSERVED STATE: A concludes the requested filename was a naming discrepancy and reviews AD-I-045 instead; **the requested file existed**
- TYPE: absence claim contradicted by an artifact on another branch
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-011 — BC-02.2 header after execution**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-057 header on `main`: `**P-01:** NOT EXECUTED`
- SOURCE B: AD-I-026 and AD-I-031 record an executed RI-PY P-01 handoff at 2026-08-23T21:36:53Z with a receipt
- TYPE: contract header not updated after the event it describes; **no supersession marker**
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-012 — release closure vs subsequent conflict record**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-058 (2026-07-24): *"internally consistent, technically reproducible, and constitutionally compliant… All tests pass."*
- SOURCE B: AD-I-053 (13 unresolved conflicts), AD-I-054 (27 unanswered ARI decisions), AD-I-063 (`Reconciled: 0 of 5`), all dated 2026-08
- TYPE: historical assessment vs later-recorded open state; A carries no supersession marker
- **RESOLUTION: NONE** — recorded per §17: HISTORICAL FACT is not CURRENT AUTHORITY

**AD-DIV-013 — "deliberately absent" artifacts that are present**
- SOURCE A: AD-I-059 lines 15–17: *"`D3_REAL_CHAIN_RUST_OUTPUT.json`, `D3_REAL_CHAIN_CANONICAL.bin`, `D3_REAL_CHAIN_RUST_PROVENANCE.md` and `D3_REAL_CHAIN_EXECUTION_REPORT.md` are deliberately absent."*
- SOURCE B: `git ls-tree origin/main` in `aura-guard-v1.3` lists `D3_REAL_CHAIN_RUST_OUTPUT.json` (blob `3dc846bb6f7d`) and `D3_REAL_CHAIN_CANONICAL.bin` (blob `d71a3c9a7c00`), both added at `70b9881`
- OBSERVED STATE: two of the four named files are present on the same branch that carries the record declaring them absent; the other two (`…RUST_PROVENANCE.md`, `…EXECUTION_REPORT.md`) are indeed not present — a differently-named `D3_REAL_CHAIN_PROVENANCE.md` is
- TYPE: stop-report statement of absence outlived by later work; no supersession marker
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-014 — organization name in reference descriptors**
- SOURCE A: `reference/RI-RS_AURA_GUARD.md`: `https://github.com/AuraIDToken/aura-guard-v1.3`
- SOURCE B: repositories in scope are under `Aura-IDToken`
- TYPE: identifier divergence in a reachable descriptor
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-015 — org guidelines describe a different repository set**
- SOURCE A: `.github/GUIDELINES.md` §1 names `aura-protocol`, `aura-devos`, `aura-brand`
- SOURCE B: the repositories observed are `aura-specification`, `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3`, `aura-guard-v1.3`, `.github`, `cargo`
- TYPE: organization-level governance document describing an unobserved topology
- **RESOLUTION: NONE**

**AD-DIV-016 — `DEP-001…005` declared satisfied**
- SOURCE A: task headers and gate blocks quoted by AD-I-045 (`D-7`) and AD-I-048 (`DIV-02`) as stating `DEP-001…005 SATISFIED FOR P-01`
- SOURCE B: AD-I-035 §19, AD-I-036 §8, AD-I-028 §16.3, AD-I-037 §15.1 and AD-I-040 §C.5 all record them **OPEN**; no closure artifact is reachable
- OBSERVED STATE: **the declaring headers are not themselves repository-resident artifacts** in the searched refs; the corpus side is five records, all OPEN
- TYPE: instruction-level declaration vs corpus content
- **RESOLUTION: NONE** — held UNKNOWN, not converted

**Total declaration-vs-content divergences recorded: 16.**

## 6. CONFLICT REGISTER

`Resolution` is `UNRESOLVED` unless the corpus itself contains an explicit
authoritative supersession or resolution.

## 7. SUPPRESSION OF FALSE SUPERSESSION

No artifact is marked SUPERSEDED in this record on the basis of a later artifact
existing. Supersession was tested against the four acceptable evidence forms
(explicit supersession statement, explicit replacement statement, authoritative
governance act, explicit deprecation/replacement record).

| Candidate supersession | Evidence found | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|
| AD-I-026 over AD-I-025 and AD-I-029 (BLOCKED → COMPLETE) | chronology only; no marker on either superseded record | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-027 over AD-I-025 | an **explicit statement** in AD-I-027 §5: *"The present record supersedes it as the current custodian state"* — made by a record that simultaneously declares it creates no authority | **ASSERTED; NOT ESTABLISHED** (see AD-CFL-008) |
| AD-I-027 §4 over AD-I-023 §18 | explicit statement, same caveat; AD-I-023 not modified | **ASSERTED; NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-038 (v2) over AD-I-023 (v1) | AD-I-048 §2.1 records v1 as *"superseded for new receivers by v2"*; **no supersession act, and no receiver implements v2** | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-039 (`PRE-01 — PASS`) over AD-I-037 (`PRE-01 — OPEN`) | chronology and substantive sequence; no marker on AD-I-037 | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** — this is the PRE-01 status-token history §10 of the mandate names specifically |
| AD-I-048 over AD-I-045, or AD-I-045 over AD-I-048 | **none in either direction.** Neither package mentions the other; both disclaim authority | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-046 (review surface) over AD-I-048 | AD-I-046 records AD-I-048's path as ABSENT rather than superseded | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-013 (English APS-200) over AD-I-018 (Polish APS-200), or the reverse | no marker on either; identical declared version | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-001 over AD-I-002/003 | none | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-006 (v0.1.0 status snapshot) by later document headers | none | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-060/061 over AD-I-059 (`deliberately absent` → present) | none | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-053/054/063 over AD-I-058 (release closure) | none | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| AD-I-009 vs AD-I-007 (same ADR, two paths, two statuses) | none | **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** |

**One correction in the corpus does carry adequate in-place evidence** and is
recorded as such, not as a supersession of a document: AD-I-057 §0, the
`source_commit` correction `64bf959` → `d943807`, which states the reason,
retains the superseded value, and names its authorization. It supersedes **a
value**, not a record.

**Total supersessions established by this audit: 0.**

## 8. REACHABILITY ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Counts

| Repository | Load-bearing artifacts inventoried | REACHABLE_FROM_MAIN | BRANCH_LOCAL | UNREACHABLE (referenced, not located) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aura-specification` | 48 groups/records | 34 | **14** | 9 (§2.7) |
| `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` | 10 | 10 | 0 | — |
| `aura-guard-v1.3` | 4 | 4 | UNKNOWN (branch set not enumerated) | — |
| `.github` | 1 | 1 | UNKNOWN | — |
| `cargo` | 1 | 1 | UNKNOWN | — |

**Branch-local load-bearing artifacts: 14** (AD-I-035 … AD-I-048), all in
`aura-specification/conformance/boundary/`, distributed across **five** branches:

| Branch | Branch-local load-bearing artifacts |
|---|---|
| `claude/bc-02-immutable-fixture-handoff-3s3fkp` | AD-I-035 |
| `claude/bc-02-boundary-validation-q0h7yg` | AD-I-036 |
| `claude/ri-rs-p01-handoff-ga84l6` | AD-I-037 |
| `claude/bc-02-1-pre-01-schema-kvvm8z` | AD-I-038 … AD-I-046 (9) |
| `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q` | AD-I-047, AD-I-048 |

### 8.2 The authority-text reachability finding

```text
AUTHORITY TEXT REACHABILITY:
BRANCH-LOCAL
```

`BC-02_IMMUTABLE_FIXTURE_HANDOFF.md` (AD-I-035) is the sole source of
`B-VAL-011…020`, `BNC-1…BNC-7`, `VE-01…VE-05` and `DEP-001…005`. Every clause
that Decision A and Decision B turn on — under **either** package's partition —
is quoted from it. It exists at exactly one commit on exactly one branch and is
not an ancestor of `origin/main`.

```text
MAIN-ONLY AUDITABILITY:
NOT ESTABLISHED
```

**This is not a finding of invalidity.** Per §11 of the mandate under which this
audit is conducted, branch-local status is recorded as a fact about reachability
and nothing is inferred from it about semantic validity.

### 8.3 Cross-branch dependency

Both Decision Packages cite records that are not reachable from their own
branches:

| Package | Cites | Reachable from the package's own branch? |
|---|---|---|
| AD-I-045 (`…kvvm8z`) | `R1` = AD-I-035 (`…3s3fkp`), `R2` = AD-I-036 (`…q0h7yg`), `R8` = AD-I-037 (`…ga84l6`) | **NO** |
| AD-I-048 (`…8ewd0q`) | `N-01` = AD-I-035, `N-02` = AD-I-036, `N-10` = AD-I-037, `N-11…N-14` = AD-I-038…041 (`…kvvm8z`) | **NO** |

**No single ref in the corpus carries the complete BC-02 record set.** A reader
must assemble it from five branches plus `main`. Recorded; not remedied.

## 9. AUTHORITY ANALYSIS

For each authority-bearing artifact: (1) explicit claim? (2) domain claimed?
(3) upstream evidence present? (4) established? (5) conflicting authority?
(6) reachable from `main`?

| Artifact | 1. Explicit claim | 2. Domain | 3. Upstream evidence | 4. Established | 5. Conflicting authority | 6. On `main` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AD-I-001 Constitution | YES | all Aura governance | self-declared FROZEN; no ratification artifact observed | **ASSERTED** | AD-I-002 (conditional freeze), AD-I-051 | YES |
| AD-I-004 GOVERNANCE (GOV-001) | YES | approval routes, status transitions | DRAFT | **CANDIDATE** | AD-I-007, AD-I-051, AD-I-052 | YES |
| AD-I-010 APS-001 | YES — *"Root Normative Specification"* | protocol semantics | Constitution (FROZEN) | **CANDIDATE** — itself DRAFT, review required | AD-I-051 | YES |
| AD-I-011…017 APS set | YES — each `Classification: Normative Specification` | protocol semantics | APS-001 (DRAFT) | **CANDIDATE** | duplicate Polish set (AD-CFL-001) | YES |
| AD-I-021 CONF-003 | YES — *"normative conformance requirement"* | canonical serialization; §4.5 is the execution gate | APS-400 §4 (DRAFT) | **CANDIDATE** — header DRAFT | AD-CFL-018, AD-CFL-020 | YES |
| AD-I-049 `CLAUDE.md` ladder | YES — orders 10 tiers | agent conduct + authority ordering | none for the ordering itself | **UNRESOLVED** | AD-CFL-004 | YES |
| AD-I-051 Constitutional Decree | YES — `MANDATORY / NON-OVERRIDABLE`, `Perpetual` | constants, arithmetic, architecture | Custodian named; no ratification artifact observed | **ASSERTED** | AD-I-001, AD-I-010, AD-CFL-005 | YES |
| AD-I-052 Custodian Role | YES — `FINAL AUTHORITY` over `core/`; `SOLE AUTHORITY` over sealing | implementation corpus | self-declared `CANONICAL` | **ASSERTED** | AD-I-004 (Chief Architect route) | YES |
| AD-I-027 BC-02 closure | **Disclaims** (*"Authority created: NONE"*) while performing supersession and issuing a *"Custodian decision"* | BC-02 chain state | cites a named custodian authorization; **no signed artifact observed** | **UNRESOLVED** | AD-CFL-008 | YES |
| AD-I-035 BC-02 contract | **Disclaims** — *"NON-NORMATIVE / Authority created: NONE"* | boundary handoff engineering | consumed authorities absent | **NONE (self-declared)** | AD-CFL-009, AD-CFL-013, AD-CFL-014 | **NO** |
| AD-I-045, AD-I-048 packages | **Both disclaim** | routing only | — | **NONE (self-declared)** | AD-CFL-017 | **NO** |
| AD-I-062 guard DQ-002 verdict | Implicit — states an adoption | hash-domain model, protocol scope | none observed | **UNRESOLVED** | AD-CFL-019 | YES |

### 9.1 Questions this section does NOT answer

Per the mandate, and stated explicitly so the boundary is unambiguous:

- Whether Chief Architect outranks Protocol Custodian — **NOT DECIDED**
- Whether ARI is protocol content or instrument content — **NOT DECIDED (C-1)**
- Which corpus's authority ladder governs — **NOT DECIDED (C-2)**
- Whether AD-I-027 held the authority to declare AD-I-025 superseded — **NOT DECIDED**
- Whether either Decision Package's A/B partition is the correct one — **NOT DECIDED**

No authority path is created, recommended, ranked or scored anywhere in this
record.

## 10. ARI — RECORDED SURFACE (NO NORMALIZATION)

ARI is treated as an **unresolved normative surface**. The following are
recorded strictly at the level the corpus supports, using only the vocabulary
`IMPLEMENTED` / `OBSERVED` / `PROPOSED` / `CANDIDATE` / `UNKNOWN`.

| Item | Where observed | Recorded as | Explicitly NOT recorded as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RAW_ARI = 0.3·SI + 0.7·SA` | `core/evaluator.py:4, :97` (AD-I-056) | **IMPLEMENTED / OBSERVED** | not NORMATIVE, not REQUIRED, not CANONICAL |
| `SCALING_FACTOR = 100000`; weights `30000` / `70000` | `core/evaluator.py:12, :22–23` | **IMPLEMENTED / OBSERVED** | as above |
| `Q16.16` | AD-I-051 Art. I §1; `.github/copilot-instructions.md:20`; `.github/github/copilot-instructions.md:18` | **CANDIDATE** (declared constitutional constant; **implemented nowhere**) | as above |
| `scale = 100000` as a constitutional constant | AD-I-051 Art. I §1, §8 (`FROZEN`) | **CANDIDATE / declared** | as above |
| `RAW_ARI` as a named quantity | `core/evaluator.py`; `RD-006_ARI_OBSERVABILITY.md` | **IMPLEMENTED / OBSERVED** | as above |
| `adjusted_ari` | core implementation and tests | **IMPLEMENTED / OBSERVED** | as above |
| ARI as a protocol term | `glossary/GLOSSARY.md:27-28` — *"computed by RI-PY … a measurement, not a decision"* | **OBSERVED** — a definition by deferral to an implementation | as above |
| `B-I` / `B-II` | AD-I-045 §5.3 (options under its Decision B) | **PROPOSED** — stated options, neither selected | as above |
| `input_segment_sha256` | AD-I-035 §5.3 and §7.1 (two incompatible readings in one document) | **UNKNOWN** | as above |
| issuer-sealed interpretation | AD-I-035 §5.3; AD-I-045 `B-I`; AD-I-048 `A-2-β` | **CANDIDATE** | as above |
| receiver-recomputed interpretation | AD-I-035 §7.1; AD-I-045 `B-II`; AD-I-048 `A-2-α`; implemented by both receivers | **IMPLEMENTED / OBSERVED** as behaviour; **CANDIDATE** as semantics | as above |

**No ARI semantics are defined, selected, ranked or inferred anywhere in this
record.** No implementation behaviour is promoted to specification. No fixture,
test or reference implementation is promoted to authority.

---

## 11. C-1 / C-2 — EVIDENCE INVENTORY ONLY

```text
C-1  Is ARI protocol content or instrument content?     OPEN
C-2  Which governance corpus has precedence for ARI?    OPEN
```

Both are **defined in the corpus** at
`aura-poc-a-core-v3.3/review/2026-08-12_OQ-A_GOVERNANCE_JURISDICTION/06_ARI_DECISION_AUTHORITY.md:111-112`
(AD-I-053). That record's own finding is `CONDITIONALLY DETERMINABLE`, and it
states: *"Who may establish ARI semantics cannot be stated today."*

Evidence relevant to C-1 and C-2 located by this audit, **inventoried without
weighting**:

| Evidence | Bears on | Recorded fact |
|---|---|---|
| AD-I-022 — ARI's only occurrence in the specification corpus, defined by deferral to RI-PY | C-1 | The specification corpus does not define ARI |
| AD-I-051 Art. I — ARI constants declared constitutional constants in the implementation corpus | C-1, C-2 | The implementation corpus does fix them |
| AD-I-053 §1 — exhaustive check of 10 authority grants: **none names ARI** | C-1, C-2 | No role holds named authority over ARI |
| AD-I-053 §2 — Chief Architect route (specification ladder) vs Custodian route (implementation ladder), both explicitly documented | C-2 | Two documented routes, neither established for ARI |
| AD-I-053 `OQ-A-CONFLICT-001`, `-004`, `-010`, `-013` | C-2 | Cross-corpus and intra-corpus authority conflicts, 0 of 13 reconciled |
| AD-I-054 `ARI-D-001` — whether Aura undertakes to define ARI at all — **open**, gating 26 further decisions | C-1 | 27 decisions, 0 answered |
| AD-CFL-018 / AD-I-063 `CFL-001` — the same cross-corpus precedence question arising for canonical encoding, `Reconciled: 0 of 5` | C-2 | The C-2 question recurs outside ARI and is unresolved there too |
| AD-CFL-019 — AD-I-062 stating a protocol-scope adoption from the implementation corpus | C-2 | A precedent act exists whose authority is unestablished |
| AD-CFL-004 — the `CLAUDE.md` ladder ordering tiers 1–5 from tier 6 | C-2 | The instrument that would settle precedence is of unestablished authority |

**No answer, no candidate ranking, no authority path, and no recommendation is
produced.** C-1 and C-2 remain exactly as the corpus leaves them.

---

## 12. DECISION A / DECISION B — RECORDED STATE ONLY

**Neither A nor B is resolved, scored, ranked or recommended here.** What this
audit records is the *state of the A/B record set*, which is itself a
normalization problem.

### 12.1 Two packages, two partitions

| | AD-I-045 — `BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` | AD-I-048 — `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` |
|---|---|---|
| Commit / time | `66bfdb1` · 2026-08-24T20:12:29Z | `dd11311` · 2026-08-24T20:26:23Z |
| Branch | `claude/bc-02-1-pre-01-schema-kvvm8z` | `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q` |
| Blob | `deaf6635787a970474ac8852e7f6f8e814f11f92` | `03d22a28274ddcab10184b56566e71cfcd3e5366` |
| Reachable from `main` | **NO** | **NO** |
| **Decision A** | **Fixture authority** — Registry supply, `fixture_hash` rule, issuance event, issuer identity, sealed store; `A-1…A-8`; options `A-I` / `A-II` / `A-III` | **Boundary transfer semantics** — interpretation of existing contract text; `A-1…A-5`; per-question candidates `α` / `β` |
| **Decision B** | **Operand semantics / BNC-1 detectability** — `B-1…B-5`; options `B-I` / `B-II` / `B-III` | **Upstream authority supply** — Registry, `fixture_hash` rule, issuer; `B-1…B-3`; candidates `α` / `β` / `γ` |
| Own record inventory | `R1…R15` | `N-01…N-17` |
| Own divergence register | `D-1…D-10` | `DIV-01…DIV-07` |
| Terrain Survey | *"CLOSED — diagnostic"* | *"CLOSED — DIAGNOSTICALLY COMPLETE"* |
| Declared authority | NONE | NONE |

**Observation, recorded without resolution:** the two packages assign the labels
`A` and `B` to substantially **transposed** question sets. AD-I-045's Decision A
(fixture/Registry/issuance authority) corresponds closely in subject matter to
AD-I-048's Decision **B**; AD-I-045's Decision B (operand semantics) corresponds
closely to AD-I-048's Decision **A**. Neither package references the other, and
neither claims precedence.

**This audit does not determine which partition governs, does not merge them,
does not rank them, and does not select A-I, A-II, A-III, B-I, B-II or B-III
under either.** See AD-CFL-017 and AD-OS-014.

### 12.2 The reviewed-package chain

```text
AD-I-047  S-3/S-4/S-5 consistency record   17:03  branch …8ewd0q   INCOHERENT
AD-I-045  Decision Package A/B             20:12  branch …kvvm8z   A, B OPEN
AD-I-048  Decision Package A/B v1          20:26  branch …8ewd0q   A, B PREPARED
AD-I-046  Decision Review Surface v1       22:20  branch …kvvm8z   reviews AD-I-045;
                                                                   records AD-I-048's
                                                                   path as ABSENT
```

All four are branch-local. Three of the four declare a *Terrain Survey* closed;
**no Terrain Survey artifact exists** (§2.7). Recorded as AD-N-009.

### 12.3 Items explicitly not touched

`B-VAL-012`, `B-VAL-014`, `BNC-1…BNC-7`, `CONF-003 §4.5`, `N-01…N-08` and
`C1–C8` were **not executed**. No fixture, Registry entry, issuance record or
receipt was created or modified. `input_segment_sha256` semantics were **not
determined**. Issuer-sealed vs receiver-recomputed was **not determined**.
Fixture authority was **not determined**.

## 14. OPEN LOAD-BEARING SURFACES

Each surface states `WHY OPEN`, `SOURCE`, `DEPENDENCY`, `DOES NOT RESOLVE`.
**No solution is proposed for any of them.**

### GOVERNANCE

**AD-OS-001 — Cross-corpus precedence**
WHY OPEN: no precedence rule between the specification corpus and the implementation corpus exists in either corpus; the only text ordering them (AD-I-049) is itself of unestablished authority.
SOURCE: AD-I-053 `OQ-A-CONFLICT-001`, `-003`, `-010`; AD-I-063 `CFL-001`.
DEPENDENCY: every cross-corpus semantic question, including C-2 and AD-CFL-018.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: this audit records the conflict and answers none of it.

**AD-OS-002 — Constitutional freeze condition**
WHY OPEN: two copies of `AURA-CON-001` v1.0 declare `FROZEN` and `FROZEN (po zatwierdzeniu)` respectively.
SOURCE: AD-I-001, AD-I-002.
DEPENDENCY: precedence tier 1.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: neither copy is selected.

**AD-OS-003 — ADR-001 identifier**
WHY OPEN: one identifier, three documents, three statuses, two subjects.
SOURCE: AD-I-007, AD-I-008, AD-I-009.
DEPENDENCY: any citation of `ADR-001`, including the SPEC-approval-authority claim.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no renumbering, no selection.

**AD-OS-004 — Authority of the governance-reconciliation act**
WHY OPEN: AD-I-027 declares a supersession and issues a "Custodian decision" while declaring it creates no authority; no signed or countersigned artifact was observed.
SOURCE: AD-I-027 §2, §5, §14; AD-CFL-008.
DEPENDENCY: the current BC-02 state as visible from `main`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: the assertion is recorded; its effectiveness is not adjudicated.

### SPECIFICATION

**AD-OS-005 — Which text is the specification**
WHY OPEN: every APS document and the Constitution exist as two representations, in two languages, at one document ID and one declared version, with no supersession marker; `STYLE_GUIDE.md` §12 requires English for normative documents but marks neither set.
SOURCE: AD-I-001…003, AD-I-011…019, AD-I-005.
DEPENDENCY: precedence tiers 1–3 in their entirety.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: neither representation is selected.

**AD-OS-006 — Normative status of a DRAFT corpus**
WHY OPEN: every document in precedence tier 2 is `DRAFT` while declaring `Classification: Normative Specification`; CONF-003 additionally asserts in-force normative effect from a DRAFT header.
SOURCE: AD-I-010…017, AD-I-021.
DEPENDENCY: every conformance claim.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no status transition is performed or proposed.

**AD-OS-007 — Canonical encoding**
WHY OPEN: `CLOSED — PASS` in one corpus, `NOT ESTABLISHED` in the other, and three contradictory statuses inside one repository.
SOURCE: AD-CFL-018, AD-CFL-020, AD-I-055, AD-I-063.
DEPENDENCY: DQ-002, DQ-006, INV-003, INV-011, CONF-003, CONF-010, the fixture corpus.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no side is chosen.

### MEASUREMENT / ARI

**AD-OS-008 — C-1: is ARI protocol content or instrument content**
WHY OPEN: the specification corpus defines ARI only by deferral to an implementation; the implementation corpus fixes it as a constitutional constant; no authority grant names ARI.
SOURCE: AD-I-022, AD-I-051, AD-I-053 §1, §6.
DEPENDENCY: `ARI-D-001` and, through it, the other 26 ARI decisions.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **explicitly not answered.**

**AD-OS-009 — C-2: which corpus's ladder governs ARI**
WHY OPEN: two documented routes (Chief Architect / Protocol Custodian), neither established for ARI; the same question recurs unresolved for canonical encoding.
SOURCE: AD-I-053 §6; AD-CFL-018, AD-CFL-019.
DEPENDENCY: C-1's operative effect; every ARI decision.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **explicitly not answered.**

**AD-OS-010 — Q16.16 vs decimal 10^5**
WHY OPEN: both are declared immutable constitutional constants in one article with no stated relationship; the implementation uses only the decimal scale.
SOURCE: AD-I-051 Art. I §1; AD-I-056; AD-I-054 `C-14`.
DEPENDENCY: `ARI-D-007`, `ARI-D-008`, `ARI-D-014`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no reconciliation is offered.

### EVIDENCE

**AD-OS-011 — Superseded-in-fact dispositions carried unmarked**
WHY OPEN: at least four records (AD-I-025, AD-I-029, AD-I-057 header, AD-I-059) present dispositions that later events changed, with no supersession vocabulary available in the corpus.
SOURCE: AD-DIV-004, AD-DIV-011, AD-DIV-013.
DEPENDENCY: any reader reconstructing current state from document faces.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: nothing is marked, nothing is edited.

**AD-OS-012 — Whether the stored receipt file is the transport artifact**
WHY OPEN: both adapters append `0x0A` beyond the §12 serialization; whether the stored file or the serialization is the artifact is undetermined.
SOURCE: AD-I-025 §4.1 `A-OBS-01`; AD-I-027 §11.
DEPENDENCY: §12 compliance reading of every stored receipt.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: recorded `DEFERRED / NON-BLOCKING` in the corpus; unchanged here.

### CONFORMANCE

**AD-OS-013 — B-VAL-014 has no implemented evidence representation**
WHY OPEN: `B-VAL-014` requires two operands; both deployed receivers emit `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` with one digest field; the v2 schema that represents both is branch-local and bound to no receiver.
SOURCE: AD-I-023, AD-I-033, AD-I-038, AD-I-057; AD-CFL-016.
DEPENDENCY: any future `B-VAL-014` execution; `CONF-003 §4.5`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no binding is performed; `B-VAL-014` is **NOT EXECUTED**.

**AD-OS-014 — Which A/B partition is the decision set**
WHY OPEN: two Decision Packages exist, both branch-local, both disclaiming authority, assigning transposed question sets to the labels `A` and `B`.
SOURCE: AD-I-045, AD-I-048; AD-CFL-017.
DEPENDENCY: any Custodian ruling described as "Decision A" or "Decision B".
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **neither package is selected, merged, ranked or renamed.**

**AD-OS-015 — BNC-1 detectability**
WHY OPEN: `BC-02` §5.3, §7.1, §14 and §15.3 are recorded as not jointly satisfiable without determining which value `input_segment_sha256` carries.
SOURCE: AD-I-035; AD-I-041 §L.4; AD-I-047; AD-CFL-013.
DEPENDENCY: `B-VAL-012`, `B-VAL-014`, `BNC-1`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **explicitly not answered; nothing executed.**

### IMPLEMENTATION

**AD-OS-016 — Adapter assertion narrower than the schema assertion**
WHY OPEN: RI-RS `R-VAL-002` adds a fixture-specific conjunct beyond BC-02.1 §15; RI-PY does not.
SOURCE: AD-I-025 §4.2 `A-OBS-02`; AD-CFL-012.
DEPENDENCY: cross-receiver symmetry of the validation harness.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: recorded `DEFERRED`; no code is changed.

**AD-OS-017 — Guard-repository branch coverage**
WHY OPEN: this audit searched only the checked-out branch of `aura-guard-v1.3`, `.github` and `cargo`.
SOURCE: §1.2.
DEPENDENCY: any corpus-wide absence claim touching those repositories.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: the gap is declared, not closed.

### REGISTRY / ISSUANCE

**AD-OS-018 — No Fixture Registry**
WHY OPEN: `CONFORMANCE_FIXTURE_REGISTRY_v1` is a declared consumed authority of `BC-02` and exists nowhere across 56 + 79 refs.
SOURCE: AD-I-035 §4.1; §2.7.
DEPENDENCY: `DEP-001`, `VE-01`, `B-VAL-011`, `B-VAL-012`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **no Registry is created.**

**AD-OS-019 — No issuance record and no issuer identity**
WHY OPEN: `BC-02` §5.3 and §7.1 require issuer-computed values at seal time; no issuance record, `issuance_id` value or issuer identity exists.
SOURCE: AD-I-035; AD-I-032; AD-I-030 §11.
DEPENDENCY: `DEP-003`, `VE-03`, the top two arrows of the §5.5 traceability chain.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **no issuance record is created.** The artifact's byte identity (§1.4) is not evidence of issuance.

**AD-OS-020 — `fixture_hash` rule undeclared**
WHY OPEN: neither covered octets nor encoding is declared anywhere; `BC-02` §5.4 states that comparing a Registry's declared value against itself *"has verified nothing"*.
SOURCE: AD-I-035 §5.4; `DEP-002`, `VE-02`.
DEPENDENCY: `fixture_hash_verification`, held UNKNOWN.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no rule is declared; UNKNOWN is preserved, not converted.

### AUTHORITY TOPOLOGY

**AD-OS-021 — Load-bearing text unreachable from `main`**
WHY OPEN: 14 load-bearing artifacts, including the BC-02 contract itself, exist only on five branches; no single ref carries the complete record set.
SOURCE: §8.
DEPENDENCY: `main`-only auditability of the entire boundary programme.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **nothing is merged; no PR is opened; integration is a question, not an action taken here.**

**AD-OS-022 — Absence of a supersession vocabulary**
WHY OPEN: the corpus has no status token for "overtaken by a later recorded event"; both Decision Packages record this gap and neither fills it.
SOURCE: AD-I-045 §3.2 (`D-6`); §7 of this record.
DEPENDENCY: every status-token history, notably `PRE-01`.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: no vocabulary is created.

**AD-OS-023 — `DEP-001…005` held UNKNOWN**
WHY OPEN: declared `SATISFIED FOR P-01` by task headers; recorded `OPEN` by five artifacts; no closure artifact reachable.
SOURCE: AD-DIV-016.
DEPENDENCY: the BC-02 entry condition.
DOES NOT RESOLVE: **held UNKNOWN; not converted in either direction.**

**Total open load-bearing surfaces: 23.**

## 15. NORMALIZATION FINDINGS

Each finding is observational. `STATUS` never records a fix.

---

**AD-N-001 — Two Custodian Decision Packages A/B exist with transposed A/B partitions**
SOURCE: AD-I-045 (`66bfdb1`, blob `deaf6635…`), AD-I-048 (`dd11311`, blob `03d22a28…`).
OBSERVATION: Two artifacts, committed 14 minutes apart on disjoint branches, both titled a Custodian Decision Package A/B, both declaring the Terrain Survey closed and A and B open, assign substantially transposed question sets to the labels `A` and `B`. Neither references the other; neither claims precedence.
IMPACT: A ruling expressed as "Decision A" or "Decision B" is ambiguous until the governing package is identified. **A ruling issued against one package does not map onto the other.**
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-002 — Both Decision Packages are unreachable from `main`**
SOURCE: §8.1.
OBSERVATION: Neither package, nor the review surface reviewing one of them, nor the contract they analyse, is reachable from `origin/main` of `aura-specification`.
IMPACT: A Custodian reading `main` sees no decision package and no BC-02 contract.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-003 — The most load-bearing artifact in the boundary programme is branch-local**
SOURCE: AD-I-035 at `e2066bd`, branch `claude/bc-02-immutable-fixture-handoff-3s3fkp`.
OBSERVATION: `BC-02_IMMUTABLE_FIXTURE_HANDOFF.md` is the sole source of `B-VAL-011…020`, `BNC-1…BNC-7`, `VE-01…VE-05` and `DEP-001…005`, and is cited by every downstream record including records that are on `main`.
IMPACT: `MAIN-ONLY AUDITABILITY: NOT ESTABLISHED` for the entire boundary chain.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-004 — No single ref carries the complete BC-02 record set**
SOURCE: §8.3.
OBSERVATION: The set spans `main` plus five branches; both packages cite records unreachable from their own branches.
IMPACT: Every reading of the corpus is partial unless the reader assembles six refs.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-005 — Two absence claims are contradicted by artifacts on other branches**
SOURCE: AD-DIV-009 (AD-I-045 §2), AD-DIV-010 (AD-I-046 §1.1).
OBSERVATION: Both claims are stated as corpus-wide (*"no reachable commit of any in-scope repository"*) without naming the ref set measured. Each is contradicted by an artifact committed earlier on a different branch.
IMPACT: Corpus-wide absence claims in this corpus are not independently reproducible unless the measured ref set is stated.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-006 — Contradictory gate snapshots coexist on `main`**
SOURCE: AD-I-023 §18 vs AD-I-024 §7.
OBSERVATION: One says `NOT STARTED` for both receivers; the other says `CONSTRUCTED` for both. Two separate records identify the first as stale and each states it was deliberately not modified.
IMPACT: The `main`-visible BC-02 chain state is self-contradictory.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-007 — Supersession is asserted by a record that declares it creates no authority**
SOURCE: AD-I-027 §2 vs §5, §13, §14.
OBSERVATION: The record simultaneously disclaims authority and performs a governance act (supersession, custodian decision, gate-state declaration).
IMPACT: Whether the supersession is effective, and therefore what the current BC-02 state is, rests on an unestablished authority claim.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-008 — The corpus has no vocabulary for supersession**
SOURCE: AD-I-045 §3.2 — the normalized set contains no token for it; §7 of this record.
OBSERVATION: At least six superseded-in-fact dispositions are carried unmarked. Zero supersessions were established by this audit.
IMPACT: State must be reconstructed by chronology, which §9 and §10 of this audit's mandate forbid as a resolution method.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-009 — Three records declare a Terrain Survey closed; no Terrain Survey artifact exists**
SOURCE: AD-I-045 §8, AD-I-047, AD-I-048 §3; §2.7.
OBSERVATION: The token *Terrain Survey* occurs in exactly four files across 56 spec refs, all of which describe its closure or scope. No survey document, scope statement or evidence log bearing that name exists.
IMPACT: The closure has no artifact to be closed against; the closure statements are the only record of the thing closed.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-010 — `PRE-01` carries opposite dispositions in two branch-local records**
SOURCE: AD-I-037 (`OPEN — OUTCOME B`) vs AD-I-039 (`PASS`).
OBSERVATION: Neither is reachable from `main`; they sit on different branches; the `PASS` is scoped in its own body to the schema layer but appears unqualified in gate blocks.
IMPACT: This is the status-token history §10 of the mandate names; **SUPERSESSION: NOT ESTABLISHED** in either direction.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-011 — Byte identity of the P-01 artifact is verifiable; issuance is not**
SOURCE: §1.4; AD-I-032; §2.7.
OBSERVATION: This audit independently recomputed 15 octets and SHA-256 `ecf9e98e…d4e65667`, matching every record. No Registry entry, issuance record or issuer identity exists anywhere in 56 + 79 refs.
IMPACT: The artifact is verifiable as data and unverifiable as an *issued fixture*. **A recomputed digest is not evidence of issuance, and this audit does not treat it as such.**
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-012 — One contract carries two incompatible readings of one field**
SOURCE: AD-I-035 §5.3 (*"computed once by the issuer at seal time"*) vs §7.1 (*"RECOMPUTED BY THIS RECEIVER"*).
OBSERVATION: Recorded independently by AD-I-041, AD-I-045, AD-I-047 and AD-I-048; AD-I-047's determination is `INCOHERENT — CUSTODIAN DECISION REQUIRED`.
IMPACT: `B-VAL-014`'s discriminating power and `BNC-1`'s detectability both turn on it.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED. No reading is selected.**

**AD-N-013 — The schema required for B-VAL-014 is implemented by no receiver**
SOURCE: AD-I-038 (branch-local v2) vs AD-I-033 / AD-I-057 (both `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`).
OBSERVATION: v2 represents both operands; v1 carries one digest field; both deployed receivers emit v1; the two executed receipts are v1.
IMPACT: `B-VAL-014` has no evidence representation in any deployed implementation.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-014 — Every APS document and the Constitution exist in two languages under one identifier**
SOURCE: AD-I-001…003, AD-I-011…019; `STYLE_GUIDE.md` §12.
OBSERVATION: Root-level `.txt`/`.pdf` copies in Polish carry the same Document IDs and declared versions as the English `aps/` and `constitution/` documents, with materially different lengths (APS-200: 2 909 vs 11 445 octets) and, for the Constitution, a **different freeze condition**. Neither set is marked superseded, non-normative, or a translation.
IMPACT: Which text constitutes the specification is undetermined for the whole of precedence tiers 1–3.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-015 — `ADR-001` denotes three documents with three statuses**
SOURCE: AD-I-007, AD-I-008, AD-I-009.
OBSERVATION: `PROPOSED` / `ACCEPTED` / `DRAFT`; two of the three share a title and subject; one is a different subject entirely.
IMPACT: Any citation of `ADR-001` — including the claim that assigns SPEC approval to the Protocol Custodian — is ambiguous.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-016 — Tier-2 precedence is occupied entirely by DRAFT documents, one of which asserts in-force normativity**
SOURCE: AD-I-010…017, AD-I-021.
OBSERVATION: Every APS document is `DRAFT` while declaring `Classification: Normative Specification`; CONF-003 declares itself *"a normative conformance requirement"* under a `DRAFT` header.
IMPACT: The authority tier that the `CLAUDE.md` ladder places above all engineering records consists of documents whose own status disclaims force.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-017 — The document that orders the authority tiers sits inside the tiers it orders**
SOURCE: AD-I-049; AD-I-053 `OQ-A-CONFLICT-003`.
OBSERVATION: `CLAUDE.md` occupies tier 6 of its own ten-tier ladder and establishes the ordering of tiers 1–5.
IMPACT: The precedence rule governing this audit is of unestablished authority. **Recorded, not resolved, and not relied on to settle anything.**
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-018 — Two incompatible fixed-point representations are declared immutable in one article**
SOURCE: AD-I-051 Art. I §1; AD-I-056.
OBSERVATION: `Q16.16` and `Scaling factor: 100,000 (10^5)` are listed together as constitutional constants with no stated relationship; the implementation uses the decimal scale and **no Q16.16 implementation was located**.
IMPACT: Gates `ARI-D-007`, `ARI-D-008`, `ARI-D-014`.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-019 — ARI is defined in the specification corpus only by deferral to an implementation**
SOURCE: AD-I-022 (`glossary/GLOSSARY.md:27-28`) — the only ARI occurrence in the entire specification corpus.
OBSERVATION: The specification defines ARI as *"computed by RI-PY"*; the implementation corpus fixes its constants as constitutional; no authority grant in either corpus names ARI.
IMPACT: This is the substrate of C-1 and C-2, and of all 27 `ARI-D-*` decisions.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED. C-1 and C-2 are untouched.**

**AD-N-020 — A protocol-scope adoption is stated from the implementation corpus**
SOURCE: AD-I-062 §1.
OBSERVATION: *"Aura adopts RI-RS as the canonical hash-domain model for CK-003"*, under `Status: CONDITIONALLY CLOSED / CI-BLOCKED`, in a repository whose authority to make protocol-scope adoptions is exactly what C-2 asks about.
IMPACT: Direct evidence for C-2; a precedent act of unestablished authority.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-021 — Identifier namespaces collide across records**
SOURCE: `N-01…N-17` (AD-I-048) vs `N-01…N-08` (AD-I-045); `D-1…D-10` vs `DIV-01…DIV-07`; `PRE-01`, `PRE-01-G1…G7`, `PRE-01-001…010`; `C-1/C-2` (governance conditions) vs `C-13/C-14` (ARI candidates) vs `C1–C8` (conformance cases); `A-1…A-8` in AD-I-045 vs `A-1…A-5` in AD-I-048 denoting different questions.
OBSERVATION: A reader encountering `N-11`, `C-14` or `A-2` cannot determine the namespace from the token. This audit avoided adding to the collision by prefixing every identifier it mints with `AD-` (§1.5).
IMPACT: Cross-record citation is unsafe without the source document named alongside every identifier.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED. No identifier in any existing record is renumbered.**

**AD-N-022 — A stop report's declared absences are contradicted by present files**
SOURCE: AD-I-059 vs AD-I-060.
OBSERVATION: Two of four files declared *"deliberately absent"* are present on the same branch as the record declaring them absent, added later by different work. No supersession marker.
IMPACT: Same class as AD-N-008, in a third repository.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-023 — A regulatory release closure predates the entire open-conflict record set**
SOURCE: AD-I-058 (2026-07-24) vs AD-I-053, AD-I-054, AD-I-063 (2026-08).
OBSERVATION: The closure declares the repository *"internally consistent… constitutionally compliant"*; later records register 13 unresolved authority conflicts, 27 unanswered ARI decisions, and `Reconciled: 0 of 5`. No supersession marker on the closure.
IMPACT: **HISTORICAL FACT ≠ CURRENT AUTHORITY.** Recorded as an evolution fact, not a current state.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-024 — Organization-level governance describes an unobserved repository topology**
SOURCE: AD-I-065; AD-I-064.
OBSERVATION: `.github/GUIDELINES.md` names `aura-protocol`, `aura-devos`, `aura-brand`; reference descriptors point at `github.com/AuraIDToken/…` while the observed organization is `Aura-IDToken`.
IMPACT: Organization-level governance and reference descriptors do not resolve against the observed corpus.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-025 — Contract headers not updated after the events they describe**
SOURCE: AD-I-057 header (`P-01: NOT EXECUTED`) vs AD-I-026 / AD-I-031.
OBSERVATION: The BC-02.2 contract on core `main` still declares P-01 not executed although a P-01 handoff through RI-PY is recorded with a receipt.
IMPACT: Contract faces and evidence disagree on `main` in two repositories simultaneously.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED**

**AD-N-026 — Absence claims in this audit are bounded and the bound is declared**
SOURCE: §1.2, AD-OS-017.
OBSERVATION: `aura-specification` (56 refs) and `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` (79 refs) were searched exhaustively; `aura-guard-v1.3`, `.github` and `cargo` were searched only on their checked-out branches.
IMPACT: Any statement in this record that something is absent from the guard, org or cargo repositories is **branch-scoped, not corpus-scoped**.
STATUS: **RECORDED — NOT RESOLVED** (declared limitation, not a defect of the corpus)

**Total normalization findings: 26.**

## 17. HISTORICAL FACT VS CURRENT AUTHORITY

Recorded separately, per §17 of the mandate. Nothing below is treated as
current authority, and no historical intent is converted into a normative
statement.

| Artifact | HISTORICAL FACT | CURRENT AUTHORITY |
|---|---|---|
| AD-I-058 Release Closure Report (2026-07-24) | A regulatory release assessment was produced and recorded a passing state at that date | **NOT ESTABLISHED** — no supersession, and later records register 13 + 27 + 5 open items |
| AD-I-025 Cross-receiver pre-execution audit | Recorded `BLOCKED` at `5f226e6`; that was its correct disposition then | **NOT ESTABLISHED** as current — AD-I-027 asserts supersession; the assertion's authority is unestablished |
| AD-I-029 RI-PY evidence gap record | Recorded `BLOCKED` at 20:18 on 2026-08-23 | **NOT ESTABLISHED** as current — an RI-PY receipt exists from 21:36 |
| AD-I-023 §18 gate snapshot | Accurate when written at BC-02.1 construction time | **NOT ESTABLISHED** as current — two records call it stale; neither edited it |
| AD-I-059 D3 stop report | A stop occurred and four artifacts were withheld at that point | **NOT ESTABLISHED** as current — two of the four are present on `main` |
| AD-I-006 v0.1.0 document status | A status snapshot was taken on 2026-07-23 | **NOT ESTABLISHED** as current — document headers have since moved |
| AD-I-056 `core/evaluator.py` | An ARI implementation exists with specific constants | **NOT SPECIFICATION.** Old implementation ≠ current specification; no source establishes that relationship |
| AD-I-062 DQ-002 verdict | An adoption was stated in the guard repository | **NOT ESTABLISHED** — authority to state it is exactly C-2 |
