# AURA — DOCUMENTATION NORMALIZATION CONTROL REVIEW v1

**Document class:** Controlled provenance and normalization review — read-only
**Status:** **DRAFT / CONTROLLED ANALYSIS**
**Authority:** **NONE**
**Normative effect:** **NONE**
**Execution authority:** **NONE**
**Conformance authority:** **NONE**
**Date (UTC):** 2026-08-25
**Prepared in role:** Custodian Evidence / Documentation Auditor — **not** implementer, **not** Chief Architect, **not** authority decider.

> Navigation: this is a controlled analysis record only; see [`GOVERNANCE_STATUS_INDEX.md`](GOVERNANCE_STATUS_INDEX.md) for the current routing of governance/status records.

| Documents modified, renamed or deleted | **NONE** |
| C-1 · C-2 | **OPEN — unchanged** |
| Decision A · Decision B | **OPEN — unchanged** |
| ARI-D-001…027 | **OPEN / UNKNOWN — unchanged** |
| B-I · B-II | **UNKNOWN — unchanged** |
| B-VAL-011…020 · BNC-1…7 · CONF-003 §4.5 | **NOT EXECUTED** |
| Registry authority · issuance authority · `input_segment_sha256` semantics | **NOT RESOLVED** |
| **Normalization Gate** | **NORMALIZATION READY** — see §15 for the exact boundary |

## Reading rule for this document

Five properties are recorded separately for every artifact and are **never**
treated as equivalent:

```text
EXISTS        the object is present in some commit of some searched ref
REACHABLE     the object is present in the tree of origin/main
AUTHORITATIVE an authority act establishes it as governing
CURRENT       it is the operative record for its subject
NORMATIVE     it carries protocol-normative force
```

```text
EXISTS = YES · REACHABLE FROM MAIN = NO · AUTHORITY = NONE · NORMATIVE = UNKNOWN
```

is a **valid and complete** state, and is the state of most of the load-bearing
boundary corpus. Nothing in this document converts one of these properties into
another.

## §1 SCOPE

### 1.1 What this review is

A read-only control review of artifact **identity**, **provenance**,
**reachability**, **lineage** and **status classification** across the Aura
documentation corpus, performed to prepare a clean, auditable surface for a
future governance review.

### 1.2 The single question this review answers

> **Can the documentation be normalized at the level of identity, provenance,
> reachability, lineage and status classification without taking a normative
> decision?**

Answered in §15. **No other question is answered.**

This review does **not** answer, and must not be read as answering: which
document is correct; which interpretation should prevail; what the Custodian
should decide; or which of two conflicting records governs.

### 1.3 Baseline treated as evidence, not authority

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Baseline artifact | `AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md` |
| Baseline commit | `d606db4bd5547d876ac7f7d479c1738b2b03a3ad` |
| Baseline branch | `claude/aura-docs-normalization-audit-xkvflu` |
| Baseline blob | `00bcda956f9de2473d361a928ff7a7da7e2f5aee` |
| Declared authority of the baseline | **NONE** |
| Treated here as | **evidence baseline** — re-verified, not assumed |

Every quantitative claim inherited from the baseline was independently
re-derived in this review. Where re-derivation disagreed with the baseline, the
disagreement is recorded as a divergence against the baseline itself
(**CR-DIV-006**, **CR-DIV-007**) and is **not** silently corrected.

### 1.4 Firewall — what this review did not do

Not resolved: **C-1**, **C-2**, **Decision A**, **Decision B**,
**ARI-D-001…027**, **B-I**, **B-II**, Registry authority, issuance authority,
`input_segment_sha256` semantics.
Not executed: **B-VAL-011…020**, **BNC-1…7**, **CONF-003 §4.5**, any receiver,
any fixture, any P-01 re-execution, any conformance procedure.
Not modified: **BC-02**, **BC-02.1** (v1/v2), **APS-001/100/200/300/400/500/950**,
**RI-PY**, **RI-RS**, **Aura-Guard**, **Core**, any receipt, any fixture, any
governance file, any README.
Not created: any Registry, issuance record, fixture, or normative semantics.
No file was renamed, moved, deleted, merged, or promoted. No PR was opened.

## §2 CORPUS AND SEARCH BOUNDARY

### 2.1 Search boundary as executed

| Repository | Remote heads | Refs searched | Tags | Method | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-specification` | **57** | **all 57** | **1** (`spec-v0.1.0` → `b08433b`) | `git rev-list --all` + per-ref `ls-tree` | **COMPLETE** |
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` | **79** | **all 79** | 0 | `git rev-list --all` + per-ref `ls-tree` | **COMPLETE** |
| `Aura-IDToken/aura-guard-v1.3` | not enumerated | checked-out default branch only | — | working-tree grep | **PARTIAL — LIMITATION PRESERVED** |
| `Aura-IDToken/.github` | not enumerated | checked-out default branch only | — | working-tree grep | **PARTIAL — LIMITATION PRESERVED** |
| `Aura-IDToken/cargo` | not enumerated | checked-out default branch only | — | working-tree grep | **PARTIAL — LIMITATION PRESERVED** |

**CR-LIM-001 — Scope was not silently widened.** The guard, organization and
cargo repositories were searched at exactly the boundary the baseline audit
used. Their branch sets were **not** enumerated in this review. Any statement in
this document about the absence of something from those three repositories is
**default-branch-scoped**, never corpus-scoped.

**CR-LIM-002 — Spec ref count changed.** The baseline recorded 56 remote heads
for `aura-specification`. The current count is **57**. The additional head is
`claude/aura-docs-normalization-audit-xkvflu`, created by the baseline audit
itself. This is a provenance fact about the review process, not a corpus change.

### 2.2 `origin/main` moved between the baseline and this review — CR-PROV-001

**This is the most material provenance change since the baseline and it
invalidates one of the task's stated baseline values.**

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| `origin/main` stated in the review mandate | `528de0d` |
| `origin/main` observed at this review | **`1b249e421de374ef23bf2bcad38fd901aed3415e`** |
| Interval commits | exactly one |
| Commit | `1b249e4`, 2026-08-25T18:30:33+02:00 |
| Subject | *Aura documentation normalization audit v1 (read-only, observational) (#37)* |
| Parent | `528de0de6d34a4a7ff541db9cd93238587dac9ef` |
| Files changed | 1 added, 0 modified, 0 deleted |

Pull request #37 provenance, read from the GitHub API:

| Field | Value |

| State | `closed`, `merged: true` |

**Blob integrity across the merge — verified byte-for-byte:**

```text
blob at d606db4:AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md   00bcda956f9de2473d361a928ff7a7da7e2f5aee
blob at 1b249e4:AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md   00bcda956f9de2473d361a928ff7a7da7e2f5aee
IDENTICAL
```

**Recorded, not interpreted.** The consequence for artifact identity is that
`AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md` transitioned
`BRANCH_LOCAL → REACHABLE_FROM_MAIN` between the two reviews. Per the reading
rule in this document's preamble, **that transition changes REACHABILITY only.**
It does not make the baseline audit AUTHORITATIVE, CURRENT-by-fiat, or
NORMATIVE, and the baseline audit's own control block declares
`AUTHORITY DECISIONS: NONE`. **Merge into `main` is not an authority act, and
this review does not treat it as one.**

**CR-PROV-002 — Branch restart.** Because PR #37 was merged, the working branch
`claude/aura-docs-normalization-audit-xkvflu` was restarted from
`origin/main` = `1b249e4` before this document was written. No history was
rewritten on any other branch; no force-push was performed against merged
history belonging to anyone else.

**CR-PROV-003 — Deleted remote branch in the core repository.** During ref
refresh, `origin/claude/aura-docs-normalization-audit-xkvflu` in
`aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` was observed **deleted** upstream. The core repository
received no commit from the baseline audit, so nothing was lost. Recorded as a
provenance observation.

## §3 ARTIFACT IDENTITY

### 3.1 The five separated properties

Applied to every artifact below. `AUTH` uses the §11 vocabulary.

### 3.2 Custodian A/B package family — full identity

| # | Artifact | Repo | Branch | Commit | Blob | Octets | SHA-256 of contents | EXISTS | REACHABLE | AUTH | CURRENT | NORMATIVE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-ID-001 | `conformance/boundary/BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` | spec | `claude/bc-02-1-pre-01-schema-kvvm8z` | `66bfdb1` (2026-08-24T20:12:29Z) | `deaf6635787a970474ac8852e7f6f8e814f11f92` | 28 674 | `c05c20e9764e6f95354a6a24f964be291cb203b39e552ca069ffa49d2c2c3d21` | YES | **NO** | NONE | **NOT ESTABLISHED** | UNKNOWN |
| CR-ID-002 | `conformance/boundary/BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` | spec | `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q` | `dd11311` (2026-08-24T20:26:23Z) | `03d22a28274ddcab10184b56566e71cfcd3e5366` | 38 346 | `cd9c0e75a01e7a8f3e659e85c371599c20bd9b414ab51b4e91e068f79984ef8e` | YES | **NO** | NONE | **NOT ESTABLISHED** | UNKNOWN |
| CR-ID-003 | `conformance/boundary/BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-REVIEW-SURFACE-v1.md` | spec | `claude/bc-02-1-pre-01-schema-kvvm8z` | `a10ca5c` (2026-08-24T22:20:34Z) | `83681a728a6af9134fd4257ff1b41702f766700c` | 23 400 | `e318614c83954858270e68a3f17865c54940a3a75223e0b17cf272826bd58257` | YES | **NO** | NONE | N/A (review of CR-ID-001) | UNKNOWN |

**Corroboration recorded:** CR-ID-001's recomputed SHA-256
`c05c20e9…c2c3d21` matches, digit for digit, the value CR-ID-003 §1.2 recorded
for the artifact it reviewed. The review surface's integrity claim about its own
subject is therefore independently reproducible. **This corroborates one
integrity statement; it establishes no authority for either artifact.**

### 3.3 Decision / authority artifacts newly located by this review

Not present in the baseline inventory. Located by filename **and** content
search across all 57 spec refs.

| # | Artifact | Repo | Branch(es) | Commit | Blob | REACHABLE | Declared status / authority claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-ID-005 | `conformance/DQ-003-CUSTODIAN-DECISION.md` | spec | `dq-003/custodian-jcs-decision` | `e0011ca` (2026-08-22T22:43:48+02:00) | `166a9c1ab761` | **NO** | `Status: DECISION RECORDED — DQ-003 remains OPEN`; **`Authority: Protocol Custodian / Architecture Owner`** |
| CR-ID-006 | `conformance/DQ-003_AUDIT_SURFACE_INTEGRATION_DECISION.md` | spec | `claude/dq-003-conformance-audit-4ok63x` **and** `dq/dq-003-audit-record-hash-domain` — **identical blob on both** | `c5ad5c2` (2026-08-22T21:09:50+02:00) | `a77adcad31f4` | **NO** | `Status: EXPERIMENTAL / ARCHITECTURAL DECISION`; declares the Audit Record Contract v0 the **"single semantic authority"** for the protocol audit record |
| CR-ID-007 | `scripts/check_canonicalization_authority.py` | spec | `claude/ck003-canonical-serialization-hjlaba` | `704832a` (2026-08-20T15:56:59Z) | `e3f928fed5be` | **NO** | executable authority check, branch-local |

**CR-ID-005 and CR-ID-006 are recorded as POTENTIAL DECISION-RELEVANT EVIDENCE —
NO AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE (§13).** Both carry authority-shaped language; neither
is reachable from `main`; neither is adjudicated here. CR-ID-006 exists at one
identical blob on two branches — a **duplicate**, not a conflict (§5).

### 3.4 Artifact under review from the baseline

| # | Artifact | Repo | Commit | Blob | EXISTS | REACHABLE | AUTH | CURRENT | NORMATIVE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-ID-008 | `AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md` | spec | `1b249e4` (was `d606db4`) | `00bcda956f9de2473d361a928ff7a7da7e2f5aee` | YES | **YES** (changed since baseline) | **NONE** (self-declared) | evidence baseline only | **NONE** (self-declared) |

### 3.5 The identifier-source artifact

| # | Artifact | Repo | Branch | Commit | Blob | REACHABLE | Declared |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-ID-009 | `conformance/boundary/BC-02_IMMUTABLE_FIXTURE_HANDOFF.md` | spec | `claude/bc-02-immutable-fixture-handoff-3s3fkp` | `e2066bd` (2026-08-23T18:37:48Z) | `9cfbc0fe66578dbb52cb6012f3ea03adcb48c40c` | **NO** | `Document ID: BC-02` · `Version: 1.0-CONSTRUCTION` · `Status: CONSTRUCTION — NOT VALIDATED` · `Classification: Engineering Boundary Contract — NON-NORMATIVE` · `Layer: Boundary / transport. Not protocol authority.` · **`Authority created: NONE`** · `Authority consumed: Fixture Registry (issuance), Boundary Specification v1 (interface shape)` |

Detailed treatment at §10.

## §4 REACHABILITY

### 4.1 Reachability is a provenance fact and nothing more

Recorded per the mandate: branch locality is **not** invalidity, and absence
from `main` is **not** absence from the corpus.

### 4.2 Spec repository — boundary corpus

| Class | Count | Change vs baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Boundary artifacts reachable from `origin/main` | 27 paths under `conformance/boundary/` | unchanged |
| **Branch-local load-bearing boundary artifacts** | **14** | unchanged — all 14 re-verified §10 |
| Branch-local decision/authority artifacts newly located | **3** (CR-ID-005/006/007) | **+3** |
| Referenced but not located (Registry, issuance record, BC-01, Boundary Spec v1, Core Interface Spec v1, `BoundaryHandoffRecord`, Terrain Survey artifact) | 7 classes | unchanged |

### 4.3 Core repository — reachability correction against the baseline

The baseline recorded `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` as **BRANCH_LOCAL: 0**. This review
re-derived reachability over the whole `review/` tree across all 79 refs and
found that figure **understated**.

| Finding | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch-local `review/` packages | **19** |
| Branch-local `review/` files | **64** |
| Branches carrying them | **3** — `claude/aura-protocol-arch-review-2p0nfh`, `claude/ari-observability-ci-s47mq0`, `claude/auditentry-adapter-dq-001-h0os71` |

*"Document class: conflict record prepared for Protocol Custodian ruling. **Normative effect: NONE.** … **This is not an analytical task, not a DQ-002 decision, and not an architecture proposal.** No option is selected."*

**Recorded as CR-DIV-006 (§6).** The baseline's core figure is corrected here as
an observation about the baseline, not by editing the baseline.

### 4.4 Cross-reachability defect: `main` cites branch-local text

| Citing artifact | REACHABLE | Cited artifact | REACHABLE |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conformance/boundary/B-VAL-014-DEFINITION-RECONCILIATION-RECORD.md` | **YES** | `BC-02_IMMUTABLE_FIXTURE_HANDOFF.md` (CR-ID-009) | **NO** |
| `conformance/boundary/BC-02-CUSTODIAN-CLOSURE-RECORD.md` §15 | **YES** | `BC-02_BOUNDARY_VALIDATION_RECORD.md` §5.1 | **NO** |
| `AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md` (CR-ID-008) | **YES** | 14 branch-local artifacts | **NO** |

Three artifacts reachable from `main` cite text that a `main`-only reader cannot
resolve. Recorded; **not repaired, not merged.**

## §5 DOCUMENT LINEAGE

Lineage vocabulary: `predecessor` · `successor` · `duplicate` · `parallel record`
· `superseded` · `superseding` · `unknown`.

**Supersession was not inferred from date, version number, branch name, file name
or newer commit.** Where no explicit supersession statement exists:
`SUPERSESSION = NOT ESTABLISHED`.

| # | Artifact pair / group | Lineage relation | Explicit supersession statement present? | SUPERSESSION |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-LIN-001 | CR-ID-001 ↔ CR-ID-002 (the two A/B packages) | **PARALLEL RECORD** — disjoint branches, 14 min apart, neither cites the other | **NO** — verified: neither file contains the other's filename (0 occurrences each way) | **NOT ESTABLISHED** in either direction |
| CR-LIN-002 | CR-ID-004 → CR-ID-002 | **PREDECESSOR** — CR-ID-002 §1.5 names CR-ID-004 as its underlying per-axis analysis | not a supersession claim | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| CR-LIN-003 | CR-ID-003 → CR-ID-001 | **REVIEW OF** — CR-ID-003 declares CR-ID-001 its subject | none | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| CR-LIN-004 | CR-ID-003 ↔ CR-ID-002 | **UNKNOWN** — CR-ID-003 records CR-ID-002's path as non-existent (§9, CR-ABS-001) | none | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| CR-LIN-005 | CR-ID-006 on two branches, identical blob `a77adcad31f4` | **DUPLICATE** — same object, two refs | n/a | **N/A — duplicate, not supersession** |
| CR-LIN-006 | `BC-02.1-COMMON-RECEIPT-SCHEMA-v1.md` (main) ↔ `…-v2.md` (branch-local) | **PARALLEL RECORD** — v2 declared `CONSTRUCTED`; **no receiver implements v2** (§14) | CR-ID-002 §2.1 *describes* v1 as *"superseded for new receipts by v2"* — a description inside a self-declared non-authority record | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| CR-LIN-007 | `B-VAL-014-PREEXEC-CONTRACT-BINDING-RECORD.md` (`PRE-01 OPEN`) ↔ `BC-02.1-PRE-01-SCHEMA-CORRECTION-RECORD.md` (`PRE-01 PASS`) | **PARALLEL RECORD** — different branches, opposite tokens for one identifier | none on either | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |
| CR-LIN-008 | `BC-02-CROSS-RECEIVER-PREEXEC-AUDIT.md` (`BLOCKED`) → `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-CLOSURE-RECORD.md` | **SUPERSESSION ASSERTED** — closure §5: *"The present record supersedes it as the current custodian state"* | **YES — an explicit statement exists**, made by a record whose §2 declares *"Authority created by this record: NONE"* | **ASSERTED; AUTHORITY BASIS NOT ESTABLISHED** |

| CR-LIN-012 | CR-ID-008 at `d606db4` → CR-ID-008 at `1b249e4` | **SAME OBJECT** — identical blob, re-anchored by merge | n/a | **N/A — identity preserved, reachability changed** |
| CR-LIN-013 | `BC-02.2-CONSTRUCTION-EVIDENCE.md` §0 — `source_commit` `64bf959` → `d943807` | **EXPLICIT IN-PLACE CORRECTION** — states reason, retains superseded value, names its authorization | **YES** | **EXPLICITLY CORRECTED — value-level, not record-level.** The one clean lineage act located in the corpus |
| CR-LIN-014 | CR-ID-005 / CR-ID-006 vs any main-reachable DQ-003 record | **UNKNOWN** — no reachable counterpart located | none | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |

**Supersessions established by this review: 0.**
**Explicit corrections established: 1** (CR-LIN-013, value-level).

## §6 DECLARATION-VS-CONTENT DIVERGENCES

Resolution vocabulary is restricted to: `NONE` · `EXPLICITLY SUPERSEDED` ·
`EXPLICITLY CORRECTED` · `DUPLICATE` · `UNRESOLVED`. **No divergence is repaired.**

| # | Artifact | Location | Token declared | Actual source statement | Divergence | Provenance | Resolution |

## §7 CUSTODIAN A/B PACKAGE PROVENANCE REVIEW

### 7.1 Complete artifact set

Located by **filename** and independently by **content** across all 57 spec refs
and all 79 core refs. The core corpus contains **no** Custodian Decision Package
A/B artifact by either method.

| Artifact | Repository | Branch | Commit | Blob | Main reachable | A question set | B question set | Authority | Supersession |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` | `aura-specification` | `claude/bc-02-1-pre-01-schema-kvvm8z` | `66bfdb1` | `deaf6635787a970474ac8852e7f6f8e814f11f92` | **NO** | **Fixture authority** — Registry supply, `fixture_hash` rule, issuance event, issuer identity, sealed store, `fixture_artifact_identity`, Boundary Spec/BC-01, `input_characterization` (`A-1…A-8`; options `A-I`/`A-II`/`A-III`) | **Operand semantics / BNC-1 detectability** — which value `input_segment_sha256` carries, artifact≡segment, §15.3 satisfiability, `handoff_status` vocabulary, decode side (`B-1…B-5`; options `B-I`/`B-II`/`B-III`) | **NONE** (self-declared) | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |

  blob    03d22a28274ddcab10184b56566e71cfcd3e5366

cmp  →  NOT IDENTICAL
```

Line-level overlap, non-blank distinct lines:

| Measure | Count |
|---|---|
| Lines common to both | **15** |
| Lines unique to the first package | **324** |
| Lines unique to the second package | **425** |

**Finding:** the two packages are **not copies, not forks of one text, and not
one document under two names.** They are independently authored documents over
the same subject.

### 7.3 Semantic comparison

**They cite the same originating identifiers.** Twenty identifiers are common to
both:

```text
DEP-001  DEP-002  DEP-003  DEP-004  DEP-005
VE-01    VE-02    VE-03    VE-04    VE-05
PRE-01-G1  PRE-01-G4  PRE-01-G5  PRE-01-G6  PRE-01-G7
B-VAL-011  B-VAL-012  B-VAL-014  BNC-1  BNC-7
```

The second package additionally cites `B-VAL-013`, `B-VAL-015`, `B-VAL-019`,
`PRE-01-G2`, `PRE-01-G3`, `CG-1…CG-7`, `CONFLICT-01…06`, `GAP-07…09`.

**They differ in the A/B assignment.** Registry supply, the `fixture_hash` rule
and the issuance act appear under **A** in the first package and under **B** in
the second. Operand semantics and the artifact/segment relation appear under
**B** in the first and under **A** in the second.

| Comparison axis | Result |
|---|---|
| Identical byte-for-byte | **NO** |
| Differ in content | **YES** — 15 shared lines out of ~749 distinct |
| Differ in A/B assignment | **YES — substantially transposed** |
| Reference the same originating IDs | **YES** — 20 shared identifiers from one contract, CR-ID-009 |
| One explicitly supersedes the other | **NO** — 0 filename references in either direction |
| An authority act selects either | **NONE LOCATED** |
| A current canonical package exists | **NOT ESTABLISHED** |

### 7.4 Authority determination

```text
AUTHORITY = NONE / NOT ESTABLISHED
```

No authority act selecting either package was located in any commit of either
fully-searched repository. Both packages self-declare `Authority: NONE`. Neither
is reachable from `main`.

**No package is selected, ranked, preferred, merged, renamed or marked canonical
by this review.** Per §15 of the review mandate: newer commit ≠ supersession;
`main` ≠ authority; greater detail ≠ precedence; the word *canonical* ≠ proof of
authority.

Routed to §12 as **CR-CONF-001**.

## §8 TERRAIN SURVEY PROVENANCE REVIEW

### 8.1 Where the term occurs

Search executed over all 57 spec refs and all 79 core refs for `terrain`,
`diagnostically complete`, `survey closed`, `survey closure`.

| Repository | Files containing any of the terms |
|---|---|
| `aura-specification` | **5** |
| `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` | **0** |
| `aura-guard-v1.3` (default branch) | **0** — limitation preserved |

| # | File | Occurrences | Nature of the occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BC-02.1-S3-S4-S5-CONSISTENCY-DETERMINATION-RECORD-v1.md` | 5 | status-table row *"Terrain survey \| CLOSED — diagnostically complete (**input to this record**)"*; `C-21` row labels the Dependency Closure Report *"terrain survey"*; §D.4 verifies a *"supplied terrain state"* against sources |
| 2 | `BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` | 5 | disposition header; status row; §2 absence claim; **§8 "Terrain Survey — diagnostic closure"**; closing statement |
| 3 | `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` | 5 | status row; §1.1 purpose; **§3 "TERRAIN SURVEY — DIAGNOSTIC CLOSURE"**; §3.4 closure block; gate block |
| 4 | `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-REVIEW-SURFACE-v1.md` | 1 | quotes the commit subject of file 2 |
| 5 | `AURA-DOCUMENTATION-NORMALIZATION-AUDIT-v1.md` | several | the baseline audit's own record of this pattern |

### 8.2 The six questions

| # | Question | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Where does the term occur? | Five files, all in `aura-specification`, all in `conformance/boundary/` except the baseline audit at repository root |
| 2 | Is there a separate artifact? | **No independently identified Terrain Survey artifact was located within the searched corpus.** No file, directory or commit bears the name |
| 3 | Does the term have a definition? | **No definitional act located.** Two *retrospective scope statements* exist, and they **differ** — see §8.3 |
| 4 | Is there a formal closure record? | **No standalone closure record.** Closure is declared inside §8 of one package and §3 of another; each package closes the survey within its own text |
| 5 | Is there a supersession? | **NOT ESTABLISHED.** No record supersedes another's closure statement |
| 6 | Is it only a declaration inside another document? | **Yes, on the present evidence** — every occurrence is a declaration carried inside a record whose own subject is something else |

### 8.3 Two different retrospective scope statements

| Source | *"What the survey covered"* |
|---|---|
| `BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` §8.1 | *"Three work packages over the BC-02 / BC-02.1 corpus: the PRE-01 schema correction and its validation; the PRE-02 / PRE-03 closure record; and the dependency closure report."* Method: 55 spec branches, 80 core branches, plus three further repositories |
| `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` §3.1 | *"All refs of five in-scope repositories … the BC-02 chain contracts and schemas, every boundary governance record, the P-01 artifact and its evidence, both receiver implementations and adapters, and the reachable normative corpus (Constitution, APS-000…950, CONF-001…015)."* |
| `BC-02.1-S3-S4-S5-…-v1.md` `C-21` | identifies *"terrain survey"* with a **specific existing artifact**: `BC-02.1 PRE-02 / PRE-03 Dependency Closure Report v1 @ 5f61e62` |

Three characterizations of one named survey: two retrospective scope statements
of different breadth, and one identification with an existing document.

### 8.4 Required formulation

Stated exactly as the review mandate requires, and **not** as a claim of
non-existence:

> **The term is observed in corpus declarations; no independently identified
> Terrain Survey artifact was located within the searched corpus.**

Whether the Dependency Closure Report at `5f61e62` **is** the Terrain Survey, as
`C-21` indicates, or whether the survey is the broader activity the two packages
describe, is **not determined here**. Routed to §12 as **CR-CONF-002**.

## §9 ABSENCE-CLAIM NORMALIZATION

Every absence claim located in the load-bearing boundary corpus is reclassified
by **scope**. The corrected qualification prescribed by the mandate is applied:
where an artifact exists branch-locally, the claim is restated as
*"exists branch-locally and is not reachable from `origin/main`"* — never as
*"does not exist"*.

| # | Claim, as written | Source | Claim scope as written | Verified state | **Normalized qualification** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-ABS-001 | *"No file of that name exists in any reachable commit of any in-scope repository. Exactly one decision package exists"* | Review Surface §1.1, `a10ca5c` | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` exists at `dd11311`, blob `03d22a28…`, committed 1 h 54 min earlier on a disjoint branch | **The artifact exists branch-locally on `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q` and is not reachable from `origin/main`. Two decision packages exist.** Claim reclassified **BRANCH-SCOPED at best; as written, CORPUS-SCOPED and not sustained** |
| CR-ABS-002 | *"The terms Decision A, Decision B, Decision Package and Terrain Survey occur in no reachable commit of any in-scope repository"* | Package A/B §2, `66bfdb1` | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | *Terrain survey* occurs in `9bbe7ff`, 3 h 09 min earlier, disjoint branch | **The term occurs branch-locally on `claude/bc-02-1-consistency-analysis-8ewd0q` and is not reachable from `origin/main`.** Reclassified as above |
| CR-ABS-003 | *"`FIX-DIGEST-P01.canonical.json` — **NOT RESOLVABLE** in any repository in scope, on any branch, under any name"* | Boundary Validation Record §2.1, `b90112b` @ 2026-08-23T19:10:58Z | **CORPUS-SCOPED, TIME-ANCHORED** | first observed at `c01e37f` @ 2026-08-23T20:07:33Z — **56 minutes after the claim**; now on `origin/main`, blob `b45ffa98…` | **Correct at the moment recorded; contradicted by a later artifact. The artifact now exists and is reachable from `origin/main`. No supersession marker on the claim.** Reclassified **TIME-SCOPED — SUPERSEDED IN FACT, MARKER ABSENT** |
| CR-ABS-004 | *"`FIX-DIGEST-P01.issuance.json` — **NOT RESOLVABLE** in any repository in scope, on any branch, under any name"* — **same table row as CR-ABS-003** | same | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | **not located** on any of 57 spec refs or 79 core refs | **Sustained at the searched boundary.** One table row therefore carries one limb now contradicted and one limb still holding, unmarked |
| CR-ABS-005 | *"no handoff channel exists"* / *"no BC-02 receiver adapter exists"* | Boundary Validation Record §§3–4, `b90112b` | **CORPUS-SCOPED, TIME-ANCHORED** | `ri_py_adapter.py`, `ri-rs/src/bin/p01_handoff.rs` exist and a handoff was executed 2026-08-23T21:36–21:37Z | **Correct at the moment recorded; superseded in fact; marker absent.** TIME-SCOPED |
| CR-ABS-006 | *"No evidence of either closure or issuance is reachable in any repository in scope"* (re `DEP-001…005`) | Boundary Validation Record §8 | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | no closure artifact located on any searched ref | **Sustained at the searched boundary.** `DEP-001…005` remain **UNKNOWN**, not converted |
| CR-ABS-007 | *"No P-01 issuance record exists in the repository to cross-check against"* | RI-RS P-01 Evidence Package §11, on `main` | **REPOSITORY-SCOPED** (as written) | no issuance record on any of 57 + 79 refs | **Sustained, and its stated scope is already the correct one** |
| CR-ABS-008 | *"no BC-01 artifact resolvable on any ref of any in-scope repository"* | Package A/B v1 `DIV-04`; S-3/S-4/S-5 `C-30` | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | not located | **Sustained at the searched boundary**; `BC-01 ACCEPTED` therefore has no reachable subject |
| CR-ABS-009 | *"An authorization for receiver binding to `schema_version = 2` — none exists in any reachable commit"* | Review Surface §? (authorization table) | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | not located; both receivers verified `SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` in this review | **Sustained at the searched boundary** |
| CR-ABS-010 | *"`CONFORMANCE_FIXTURE_REGISTRY` occurs in … files which reference it or record its absence"* | Package A/B §4.2 | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | re-verified: the token occurs in exactly **7** files, all of which reference it or record its absence; **no Registry artifact** | **Sustained at the searched boundary** |
| CR-ABS-011 | *"These are recorded as unreachable sources, not as proven non-existence"* | S-3/S-4/S-5 §C.4 | **explicitly self-qualified** | — | **Already correctly qualified in the source. Recorded as the corpus's own best-practice instance** |
| CR-ABS-012 | *"…are deliberately absent"* (four D3 artifacts) | guard `D3_REAL_CHAIN_EXECUTION_BLOCKER.md` | **BRANCH/REPO-SCOPED, TIME-ANCHORED** | two of four present on the same branch; two not located under those names | **Partially contradicted; marker absent.** Guard scope is **default-branch only** — CR-LIM-001 |
| CR-ABS-013 | `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3` **`BRANCH_LOCAL: 0`** | baseline audit §8.1 | **CORPUS-SCOPED** | 19 branch-local review packages / 64 files across 3 branches | **Not sustained.** See CR-DIV-006 |

### 9.1 Summary of reclassification

| Classification | Count |
|---|---|
| **Sustained at the searched boundary** | 6 (CR-ABS-004, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010) |
| **Reclassified — artifact exists branch-locally, not reachable from `main`** | 2 (CR-ABS-001, 002) |
| **Reclassified — TIME-SCOPED, superseded in fact, marker absent** | 3 (CR-ABS-003, 005, 012) |
| **Not sustained** | 1 (CR-ABS-013) |
| **Already correctly self-qualified in the source** | 1 (CR-ABS-011) |
| **Total absence claims normalized** | **13** |

**No absence claim was rewritten in its source document.** Reclassification is
recorded here only.

**Sole-source verification.** A content search across all 57 spec refs for the
outer ranges of the identifier families (`B-VAL-015…020`, `BNC-3…6`,
`VE-04…05`) returns 11 files. Ten of them **cite** those identifiers; exactly
one **defines** them:

## §11 STATUS NORMALIZATION

### 11.1 Eight independent dimensions

Never collapsed into one global status. Vocabulary is taken from the mandate;
**no new status token was invented**.

```text
IDENTITY       repository · path · branch · commit · blob
REACHABILITY   REACHABLE_FROM_MAIN | BRANCH_LOCAL | UNREACHABLE | UNKNOWN
AUTHORITY      NONE | CANDIDATE | ASSERTED | ESTABLISHED | FROZEN | SUPERSEDED | UNRESOLVED
SEMANTIC       OPEN | UNKNOWN | PROPOSED | ESTABLISHED | SUPERSEDED
EVIDENCE       NONE | PARTIAL | OBSERVED | ESTABLISHED | CONFLICTING
CONFORMANCE    NOT DETERMINED (uniform across the corpus — §14)
EXECUTION      ALLOWED | BLOCKED | EXECUTION-GATED | N/A
SUPERSESSION   NOT ESTABLISHED | ASSERTED | EXPLICITLY CORRECTED | DUPLICATE | N/A

### 11.3 Tokens preserved verbatim

No source token was replaced anywhere in this document. Where a normalized
reading is given, the source token is quoted alongside it. `PASS` at the
engineering-validation layer and `PASS` at the conformance layer are kept
distinct throughout, and no `PASS`, `CLOSED`, `SATISFIED`, `ACCEPTED`,
`VALIDATED`, `RECONCILED` or `ISSUED` token was converted into a conformance
statement.

## §15 NORMALIZATION GATE RESULT

### 15.1 The question

> Can the documentation be normalized at the level of identity, provenance,
> reachability, lineage and status classification without taking a normative
> decision?

### 15.2 Answer

```text
NORMALIZATION GATE:  NORMALIZATION READY
```

**Yes — for the five named layers, and demonstrably so.** This review computed
all five, read-only, over a fully enumerated ref set, without selecting between
any two conflicting records and without creating any semantics:

| Layer | Normalizable without a normative decision? | Demonstrated by |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | **YES** | repository · path · branch · commit · blob · octet count · SHA-256 resolved for every artifact reviewed (§3); byte-for-byte comparison of the two A/B packages completed (§7.2) |
| **Provenance** | **YES** | first/last observed occurrence, authoring commit, merge provenance including PR #37 and blob-identity across the merge (§2.2); duplicate blob across two branches identified as a duplicate (§5) |
| **Reachability** | **YES** | `REACHABLE_FROM_MAIN` / `BRANCH_LOCAL` / `UNREACHABLE` determined per artifact against `1b249e4`; 14/14 baseline artifacts re-verified; 19 further core packages located (§4, §10) |
| **Lineage** | **YES, with a determinate negative result** | 14 relations classified; **0 supersessions established**, 1 explicit value-level correction, 2 supersessions recorded as **ASSERTED** with the authority basis left open (§5) |
| **Status classification** | **YES** | eight dimensions kept separate; every source token preserved verbatim; no token converted (§11) |

### 15.3 The boundary — stated so it is not mistaken for a gate failure

`NORMALIZATION READY` means the **map** is complete and reproducible. It does
**not** mean the corpus is internally consistent, and it must not be read as
such.

```text
ARTIFACT → IDENTITY → PROVENANCE → REACHABILITY → LINEAGE → STATUS → CONFLICT
                                                                        │
                                                                        ▼
                                                          [ DECISION GATE — OUT OF SCOPE ]
```

The chain terminates at **CONFLICT**. It does not continue into **DECISION**.

Fourteen conflicts (§12) reach the end of that chain with
`Resolution: NONE · Authority basis for selection: NOT ESTABLISHED`. Each is
fully characterized — sources identified, blobs pinned, reachability
determined, lineage tested, absence claims scoped — and each requires an
authority act that no amount of further normalization can supply. That is the
precise sense in which the surface is now **clean and audit-ready**: everything
that could be settled by looking has been settled by looking, and what remains
is visibly, and only, a matter for a future decision gate.

### 15.4 What would have made the gate BLOCKED

Recorded for completeness: the gate would be `NORMALIZATION BLOCKED` if artifact
identity could not be pinned, if reachability could not be determined, or if the
corpus could not be enumerated. None of those obtains for
`aura-specification` or `aura-poc-a-core-v3.3`. For `aura-guard-v1.3`,
`.github` and `cargo` the enumeration is **partial by design** (CR-LIM-001), so
the gate result is stated **for the two fully enumerated repositories** and is
**scope-qualified** for the other three.

## APPENDIX A — ITEMS FOR A FUTURE GOVERNANCE REVIEW

Five items. **None is resolved, none is recommended, no authority is proposed,
and no interpretation is preferred.**

**A-1 · Which A/B partition is the decision set?**
QUESTION: Two Custodian Decision Packages A/B exist; the labels `A` and `B` denote substantially transposed question sets between them.
SOURCE: `BC-02.1-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B.md` @ `66bfdb1`, blob `deaf6635…`; `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-DECISION-PACKAGE-A-B-v1.md` @ `dd11311`, blob `03d22a28…`.
CONFLICT / GAP: CR-CONF-001. Byte-distinct; 20 shared originating identifiers; no cross-reference; both `Authority: NONE`; neither reachable from `main`.
WHY IT MATTERS: A ruling expressed as "Decision A" or "Decision B" is ambiguous until the governing package is identified; a ruling against one does not map onto the other.

**A-2 · The identifier-defining contract is not reachable from `main`.**
QUESTION: `BC-02_IMMUTABLE_FIXTURE_HANDOFF.md` is the sole defining source of `B-VAL-011…020`, `BNC-1…7`, `VE-01…05` and `DEP-001…005` — re-verified independently in this review.
SOURCE: `e2066bd`, blob `9cfbc0fe…`, branch `claude/bc-02-immutable-fixture-handoff-3s3fkp`.
CONFLICT / GAP: Not an ancestor of `origin/main`; two `main`-reachable artifacts cite it.
WHY IT MATTERS: A reviewer reading only `main` cannot reach the text that every boundary question turns on. `MAIN-ONLY AUDITABILITY: NOT ESTABLISHED`.

**A-3 · Supersession is asserted but its authority basis is not established.**
QUESTION: `BC-02-CUSTODIAN-CLOSURE-RECORD.md` declares a prior audit superseded and issues a "Custodian decision" while its §2 declares *"Authority created by this record: NONE"*.
SOURCE: closure record on `main`, §2 vs §5/§13/§14; CR-LIN-008, CR-LIN-009.
CONFLICT / GAP: CR-CONF-008. The corpus contains **no supersession vocabulary at all**; 0 supersessions were establishable in this review.
WHY IT MATTERS: What the current BC-02 state is depends on whether that assertion is effective, and at least four superseded-in-fact records carry no marker.

**A-4 · The "Terrain Survey" has no independently identified artifact.**
QUESTION: Three records declare it closed; two give differing retrospective scopes; one identifies it with an existing dependency report.
SOURCE: `9bbe7ff` (`C-21`), `66bfdb1` §8, `dd11311` §3, `a10ca5c`.
CONFLICT / GAP: CR-CONF-002. The term is observed in corpus declarations; no independently identified Terrain Survey artifact was located within the searched corpus.
WHY IT MATTERS: Two decision packages rest their diagnostic closure on a survey whose subject and scope are not uniquely identified.

**A-5 · Corpus-wide absence claims were measured against unstated ref sets.**
QUESTION: Three absence claims stated as corpus-wide are contradicted by artifacts that existed at the time; one claim's two limbs now differ in status inside a single table row.
SOURCE: CR-ABS-001 (`a10ca5c`), CR-ABS-002 (`66bfdb1`), CR-ABS-003/004 (`b90112b` §2.1); reclassified in §9.
CONFLICT / GAP: None of the three names the ref set it measured; none carries a supersession marker.
WHY IT MATTERS: Governance conclusions in this corpus rest on absence claims. Unless a claim names its measured ref set, it is not independently reproducible, and *"does not exist"* and *"exists branch-locally and is not reachable from `origin/main`"* are different findings with different consequences.
